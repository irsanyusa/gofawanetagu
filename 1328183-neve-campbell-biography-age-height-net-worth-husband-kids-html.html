Ever since her first appearance in a 1991 commercial, she remained consistent until she suddenly left Hollywood.</p><h3>Why did Neve Campbell leave Hollywood?</h3><p class=align-left>According to the actress, she left because she needed a break from the famous lifestyle. In her words, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said</a>:</p>I needed a minute. In my 20s, it all hit so fast and so big that it was a little overwhelming. Wonderful, obviously, and I'm very grateful for it, but it got to a level, also, where the kinds of things that I was being offered were not the things I wanted to do. I was constantly being offered horror films, because I was known for horror films, or bad romantic comedies.<p class=align-left>Before her break, Neve Campbell and Denise Richards were famous for their erotic thriller <i>Wild Things</i>.
