Sometimes, you might end up rushing into a decision you regret later on in the future, so slow down and think about what you want.</li><li>It's better to wait for the right person instead of settling for someone who is only half right.</li><li>Marrying your best friend may sound like a good idea, but there are arguments such as "what happens if our personalities clash?"</li><li>Always keep your eyes open and know what kind of person you want to spend time with - once you stop looking, all chances of meeting someone will disappear.</li><li>Love is complicated and very often unrequited.</li><li>People who have difficulty maintaining relationships do so because they cannot control their feelings. If you're in a situation where you get jealous at every turn, it may be that you aren't ready for a serious relationship yet.</li><li>They should learn to control their emotions, manage jealousy and eventually figure out what qualities they want in a romantic partner.</li><li>Learning how to deal with difficult situations head-on is also important so one can avoid making decisions based solely on emotions alone.</li><li>You will never know if the person has feelings for you if you are too afraid to ask them out or find out more about them.</li><li>The secret to finding someone is not to sit around hoping that fate will bring them your way; take charge of your destiny and go after what you want!</li><li>When you first meet someone new, there's always a mutual feeling of attraction, but that doesn't mean it will last forever.</li><li>It's best to play things by ear rather than rushing into anything impulsively.</li><li>There is no need to rush into any commitments before being sure this is something worth committing yourself to long term.</li><li>A healthy <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1460833-100-inspirational-know-your-worth-quotes-to-help-you-see-your-value/ href=#>sense of self-worth</a> goes a long way in sustaining an emotionally healthy romantic life, avoiding codependency, and enabling others' bad behaviour patterns.</li><li>People make mistakes when they invest their trust in unreliable people.</li><li>Always look for potential red flags early on, so you don't make mistakes in the future - remember, hindsight is 20/20!</li><li>The most unbreakable rule is this- if you cheat on your spouse, they won't ever trust you again. You've lost any sense of respect they had for you, which means that any chance at rebuilding a healthy relationship has gone out the window.</li><li>A perfect relationship will be when you marry your best friend. If you are looking for a mate or someone to share your life with, make sure that you find someone as good of a friend as they are a romantic partner.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a5b1250c090bf4e4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wondering what boys want in girls?
