Although he rose to fame for his comedy, his romantic life has grabbed the spotlight multiple times. Who is Ron White’s wife?

He is a member of the comedy troupe The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. He often smoked cigars and drank whiskey in his routines. However, he quit alcohol in 2021 with the help of a hypnotherapist and ayahuasca, a South American psychoactive drink.</p><h2>Who is Ron White married to?</h2><p class=align-left>White is not married as of 2023. Although he has been married before, all his marriages have ended in divorce. He is yet to get married again.</p><h3>Ron White’s marriages</h3><p class=align-left>White has tied the knot three times, in 1981, 2004 and 2013. The <a href=#>stand-up comedian</a>’s first marriage was to Lori Brice between 1981 and 1993. He later married Barbara Dobbs in 2004 and divorced her in 2008. His third marriage was to Margo Rey, between 2013 and 2017, although they had court disputes over the actual length of their marriage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37e7bf7664f4d042.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Sal Vulcano have a wife?

They had one son together, Marshall White. The pair kept their relationship out of the limelight and never revealed why they divorced. Their son Marshall stayed with his father after their divorce. Lori has also remained away from the spotlight since their separation in 1993.</p><h4>Barbara Dobbs</h4><p class=align-left>Eleven years after his first marriage ended, the comic married again. He tied the knot with his second wife, Barbara Dobbs, in 2004. Dobbs is an interior designer who previously worked for Jeff Foxworthy, an American radio and <a href=#>television personality</a>. The couple had no children together, and Barbara has shied away from the public since their divorce.</p><h4>Margo Rey</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37e7bf7664f4d042.jpg><p class=align-left>Margo ‘Rey’ Reymundo is a Mexican singer, songwriter, and cancer survivor. Ron and Margo met through the singer’s older brother, Alex Reymundo, a <a href=#>Mexican actor</a> and stand-up comedian. Margo was performing, and her brother invited White to watch her show. He went even though he didn’t want to and was instantly attracted to her when watching her performance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6268ce60bd0825fd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Jennifer Hudson have a husband?

While Margo was Ron White’s girlfriend, they worked together on <i>Ron White Presents: Margo Rey Live</i>. Their events often blended concerts and comedy shows, with Alex included.</p><p class=align-left>The pair got married on 13 October 2013 in California. They lived in Montecito in Santa Barbara County, California. However, the <a href=#>singer and songwriter</a> filed for divorce in June 2017, starting a long court case over spousal support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0bb84dca909e0456.jpg><p class=align-left>The two have never directly addressed why they divorced. However, in 2017, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ reported</a> that White initially decided to end their relationship.

When she tried to pay for the consultation, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she discovered</a> that Ron had cut her off from their joint finances and cancelled all her credit cards. The comic had allegedly also changed all the locks to their house. She filed for divorce shortly afterwards.</p><p class=align-left>During their divorce proceedings, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Margo claimed</a> they had been married for nine years, not four. She claimed that they had been common law married since 2008. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">White claimed they</a> hadn’t been married at all, calling the 2013 ceremony a “mock marriage”. In 2019, a court upheld the marriage, causing White to pay the singer $25K monthly in spousal support.</p><p class=align-left>Although Margo and Ron haven’t been together for over five years, her brother Alex still works with Ron.
