NORQUIST:&nbsp; Ouch.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I learned all those phrases when I worked with irrigators and they ruined my life.&nbsp; But he is very sharp, very clever, very astute, did his homework.</p><p>MR. SCHERER:&nbsp; Let me ask, you’re both talking about dialogue and compromise.&nbsp; Is there any room, you think, for compromise?</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; To me, it’s always the rule of compromise.&nbsp; But to have people say I just don’t compromise on anything, those people are about as rigid as a fireplace poker but without the occasional warmth.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Is this a Western thing?&nbsp; Because I once spent a day with a guy from Alabama and we drove around and we did all these little radio shows on tax stuff.&nbsp; And went from one to another.&nbsp; And he must have had a hundred sayings along those lines and he never repeated himself.&nbsp; I kept waiting to see whether he was on a continuous loop of some kind.&nbsp; I didn’t know whether he was making them up or had a book of a thousand of them or just picked them up over time.&nbsp; It was just — people in Boston don’t talk like that.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; And they don’t work in a hayfield with guys who are called irrigators either.</p><p>(Laughter.)</p><p>Who are just terribly profound people and very earthy and well, ugly.&nbsp; No, they’re not.&nbsp;Where is Frankenstein?&nbsp; Not there.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; He’s not out.</p><p>MR. SCHERER:&nbsp; I saw one on the other side earlier.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; On the compromise stuff, one of the ways I’ve tried to frame it and explain to guys who say are you willing to compromise?&nbsp; And I said yeah, the $2.5 trillion in spending restraint that we got out of the 2011 budget deal, grand bargain, was less than the $6 trillion in spending restraint we wanted in the Ryan plan.&nbsp; So Ryan’s budget which Republicans all voted for in the House and in the Senate, but didn’t pass, didn’t pass in the Senate, was $6 trillion in spending cuts.&nbsp; We settled for $2.5 trillion.&nbsp; That’s a compromise.</p><p>I am all in favor of compromising on the road to liberty.&nbsp; So if I want $2 in spending cuts and I can only get $1, that’s progress. It’s not treason.&nbsp; I have to talk to my conservative, right of center friends all the time.&nbsp; I say if we’re here in D.C. and we’re trying to go to California and we end up in Missouri, this isn’t treason.&nbsp; Missouri is on the way to California.&nbsp; But if your feet are wet and everyone around you is speaking French, you’re losing.&nbsp; That’s not compromising.&nbsp; You’re heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>So compromising, getting to a more free society slower than you’d like, that’s okay.&nbsp; But moving in the wrong direction, backing up, I guess the football players fall back to throw the ball forward, that’s not necessarily a good idea.</p><p>[Further down, we approached the pen for the Komodo Dragon.]</p><p>MR. SCHERER:&nbsp; Here’s the dragon.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Oh yes, oh, my goodness.&nbsp; Oh, for heaven’s sake.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; Oh, my lord, look at that baby.</p><p>(Pause.)</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; And that hole little thing is his ear?</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; They are big, aren’t they?</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Did you see that movie, The Graduate or The Freshman where they try to eat the Komodo Dragon or pretend to eat one?</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; They tried to do what?</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; They pretend they’re going to eat a Komodo Dragon.</p><p>MR SCHERER:&nbsp; Matthew Broderick was in it.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Plays the freshman.&nbsp; There’s a mobster played by Superman’s dad, Marlin Brando.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; I never saw that.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; The whole thing is they’ve got a group that pays a lot of money to eat endangered animals for dinner and they tell them they’re going to feed them a Komodo Dragon, but they feed them chicken.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; Tastes like chicken.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Everything tastes like chicken.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; Remember Adolph Green, Betty Comdon and Adolph Green, he was a great comedian.&nbsp; They did a show together.&nbsp; He’s at a play, a boring, horrible play.&nbsp; This guy in high drama said, I’ve been through life and I’ve tasted death.&nbsp; He got up and said, “Tastes like chicken?”</p><p>(Laughter.)</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp;On the compromising stuff, you and I argued once before on the immigration issue.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; Oh, we did.&nbsp; Did I lay that on you at that time that you were involved with the sticker that said “Put this in water and put it on your wrist”?</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Oh, says the Simpson-Mazzoli little sticker, yes.</p><p>(Laughter.)</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; I thought about it every night, this son of a bitch.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; I have some.&nbsp; I should have brought them for you.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; I’ve been waiting for this opportunity.&nbsp; Let me tell you, I kept some of them.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; Oh, good.&nbsp; I have a bunch.</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; Do you have a lot left over?&nbsp; Now what about going to retina scans and fingerprints.&nbsp; That’s where they’re headed now.</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp; I’m not a big fan of that either.&nbsp; On the compromise, I actually have worked with the Gang of Eight characters.&nbsp; And that’s one where, I don’t know, there may be eight, ten moving parts on immigration reform.&nbsp; And we don’t have as much in the way of a guest worker program as I’d like, H1Bs —</p><p>SENATOR SIMPSON:&nbsp; That’s very important —</p><p>MR. NORQUIST:&nbsp; — as big as I’d like.&nbsp; STEM is not as big as I want.&nbsp; But everything in there is generally a step in the right direction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirp5a6sbjAp5tnrJmism%2BvzqZma2hhaHxxgo5rbmiZnJa7br%2FIpqesp55irq%2BwjKCpqK6Vp3qvu9GqrKKrpGK0sHnTqGStoJVix7C7jmxm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falan-simpson-and-grover-norquist-go-to-the-zoo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falan-simpson-and-grover-norquist-go-to-the-zoo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falan-simpson-and-grover-norquist-go-to-the-zoo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falan-simpson-and-grover-norquist-go-to-the-zoo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falan-simpson-and-grover-norquist-go-to-the-zoo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falan-simpson-and-grover-norquist-go-to-the-zoo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-tatiana-maslany-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-tatiana-maslany-html.html>How Much Money Does Tatiana Maslany Make?
