As dealer lots became depleted of new stock and consumers faced sizable price premiums, many looked to wring out extra miles from their existing wheels. As a result, vehicles got longer in the tooth. The <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>average age</a> of vehicles in operation in 2021 — 12.1 years — exceeded the all-time high of 11.9 years in 2020.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Net promoter scores reveal a rocky road for auto service and repair providers during the pandemic</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Independent repair shops and aftermarket parts suppliers can learn from monitoring NPS data, or customers’ reported likelihood of recommending a brand. In the early months of the pandemic, scores for many aftermarket brands tumbled, which was indicative of consumers’ experiences of having to wait much longer to have their vehicles serviced. Despite bumps in the road, however, the auto repair industry has been trending back toward pre-pandemic levels since late last year.<br></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Of the major aftermarket players, Michelin’s NPS stayed mostly in the 30 to 40 range, and grew from 35 to 39 between July 2021 and January 2022. During the past six months, Pep Boys and AutoZone bounced back, their net promoter scores jumping from 8 to 19 and 29 to 34, respectively. Moving forward, repair centers should focus on providing positive customer experiences across all aspects of service.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>When choosing between servicing options, </strong><strong>consumers weigh </strong><strong>price, familiarity and availability of certified technicians</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Roughly equal proportions of consumers reported having their cars serviced at a dealership (26 percent) versus an independent repair shop (28 percent). For those whose vehicles were serviced at a dealership in the last month, familiarity, coverage under warranty and availability of certified technicians held roughly equal weight as reasons for choosing a dealership (40 percent, 38 percent and 41 percent, respectively). Only 20 percent said price was a factor.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Meanwhile, around two-thirds of those who chose not to go to a dealership cited price as a concern. As for other reasons, location and having more faith in another service provider trailed at 27 percent and 25 percent, respectively.</p><p>Dealerships were consistently preferred over independent repair shops for vehicles under warranty, and because customers value certified technicians. Independent repair shops and service centers should leverage dealerships’ approaches to keeping customers loyal through measures such as certifying and upskilling their mechanics, and backing their products and services through money-back guarantees so they don’t have to compete solely on price.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong></strong><strong>Mind the gap between expectations and reality</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Consumers who recently had their vehicles serviced reported variation between expectations and reality when it came to price and time required. The gap is especially wide in some U.S. regions. Overall, 18 percent of adults felt that their vehicles cost more to service than they expected, and 14 percent experienced longer wait times than anticipated. From a geographic perspective, the West region showed the most variance in price and time expectations, with 23 percent reporting higher-than-expected prices and 21 percent reporting longer-than-expected turnaround.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Service and repair providers can optimize their growth strategies by focusing on geographic pockets where customers’ expectations aren’t being met, and surgically targeting issues such as backlogs, inefficient parts distribution and inconsistent pricing. Understanding the drivers behind vehicle servicing patterns is key for automakers seeking to retain customers at their branded dealerships. Similarly, improving the customer experience can help independent service providers compete with their larger rivals.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5bCtbvMqKuirpViwKa%2B1aKanmWRo7FuvsSpmKKqXaeyta3IpZyrq12brqSxjK6noaGcoXqjrdOto55lpKR6uLXNZpmam5tisLa%2F06iknqqj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fautomotive-service-and-repair-retailers-face-uphill-battle-to-win-back-customers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fautomotive-service-and-repair-retailers-face-uphill-battle-to-win-back-customers.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fautomotive-service-and-repair-retailers-face-uphill-battle-to-win-back-customers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fautomotive-service-and-repair-retailers-face-uphill-battle-to-win-back-customers.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fautomotive-service-and-repair-retailers-face-uphill-battle-to-win-back-customers.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fautomotive-service-and-repair-retailers-face-uphill-battle-to-win-back-customers.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ben-platt-interview-the-politician-soundtrack-1203381427.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ben-platt-interview-the-politician-soundtrack-1203381427.html>Ben Platt on Why The Politician Wouldnt Have Worked Without Music</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./us-clean-tech-investment-going-strong.html>Actually, Clean Tech Investment is Still Going Strong</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./us-clean-tech-investment-going-strong.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
