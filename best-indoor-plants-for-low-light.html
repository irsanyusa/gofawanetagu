In assessing the plants on this list, I considered three main factors.</p><h3>Light conditions</h3><p>If the plant requires bright, direct sunlight, it won’t be a good fit for darker or shadier spaces! In order to make the cut for this list, I selected plants that are listed as thriving under a range of lower light conditions: in indirect sunlight, in the shade, or even in artificial light. I also cross-checked the information listed on websites, with information received by experts, to ensure I selected plants recommended for lower light environments.</p><h3>Size and shape</h3><p>This is a list of the best indoor plants—and that means size matters. When selecting the plants to include on this list, I considered the current size and shape of the plant as well as the likelihood of expansion. I also sought expert advice on how to select plants for specific rooms in the house, based on light conditions, size, and shape of the grown plant.</p><h3>Ease of care</h3><p>Most of us don’t have the time or energy to spend all day catering to our houseplants, so I also considered ease of care. While some plants, like orchids, will require a higher skill level to properly care for, most of the plants on this list are relatively low-maintenance, requiring moderate watering and lower light.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-indoor-plants-for-low-light>What to consider when buying indoor plants for low light</h2><h3>Sunshine in your space</h3><p>All low-light plants are not created equal. Some enjoy moderate sunshine, while others do best in shadows or even in a windowless room. Orozco-Encio says, “just because it’s an indoor plant, you can’t assume that means it’s ultra low light or that it wants sunlight. Some indoor plants need extremely low light while others will be happy in front of the window.”</p><p>For best results, Orozco-Encio suggests carefully considering the specific amount of sunlight that’s recommended for your plant, and placing it accordingly. “If you touch the window and you feel it’s warm, the sun is giving direct sunlight to the plant. So you need to make sure when you bring a plant home, look for the spot beforehand, and choose a spot that’s going to have the right sunlight level for that plant.”</p><h3>Size and shape</h3><p>When placing a plant in an indoor location, consider the current size of the plant and the size and shape you expect it to grow into over time. Orozco-Encio advises, “Some plants may grow in height, while others will tend to grow out to the side. So before choosing a spot for your plant, think about what shape it’s likely to grow into. If it’s going to have leaves growing out instead of up, it will need a lot of space around it.”</p><h3>Humidity:</h3><p>Plants are affected by more than just sunlight — they also respond to temperature and heat. Orozco-Encio says, “For some plants, you need a lot of humidity in the room. So even though the plant may do well with low light, it still may need a warmer space to thrive.” Check the instructions on the plant, or search for directions for that specific plant to learn more about the conditions it requires.</p><h2 id=how-to-water-and-maintain-indoor-plants-for-low-light>How to water and maintain indoor plants for low light</h2><p>In low-light environments, plants tend to need less water overall. So, overwatering is something to watch out for, and if your plant begins to turn from green to yellow, it’s a possible warning sign that signifies you may need to pull back on the amount of water you’re providing. However, each plant has individual needs, so according to Orozco-Encio, “always check the water and care instructions for your specific plant to gain insight into how best to maintain it.”</p><h2 id=troubleshooting-tips>Troubleshooting tips</h2><p>When a plant's leaves start turning yellow, that often spells trouble. According to Orozco-Encio, “If it’s turning yellow, it’s a sign that the plant either is experiencing too much direct sunlight, or too much water. That’s a sign from the leaves that’s telling you, ‘Take care of me! You’re doing something incorrectly.’” For yellowing leaves, she recommends reducing the water or the sunlight, depending on what you think the culprit may be, and then keeping an eye on the plant to see how it responds.</p><p>Another important consideration is your soil type. Orozco-Encio says, “Make sure you know whether it’s a flowering plant or a green plant, because that will make a difference in terms of not just the care, but the soil. When it’s a flowering plant, it requires different soil, one with more nutrients, for the plant to flower.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What indoor plants like dark rooms?</h3><p>According to Orozco-Encio, the Fiddle Leaf Fig is a popular low-light choice. “The fiddle leaf fig is very low-maintenance, and it has beautiful large green leaves. I call this one ‘the queen of the plants,’ because they don’t like it when you have too many other plants around. They grow best when they’re standing alone, not clustered with other plants. It’s low-light, low-watering, and easy to take care of. Never, never direct sunlight. The leaves get burned very quickly.”</p><h3>What houseplants do well in shade?</h3><p>According to Orozco-Encio, the Phalaenopsis orchid is a beautiful flowering plant that does well in low light and shade. “They come in various colors from white, to purple, lavender, yellow, and more. The flower itself lasts two to three months, but the plant can last forever. When the bloom dies, continue watering it, and maybe twice a year it will bloom again. This is an indoor plant, no direct sunlight, and very easy to take care of. You can water it every ten days, and we recommend spray bottle watering versus pouring water in, because it doesn’t drink a lot of water.”</p><h3>Which plants do not require sunlight?</h3><p>Romina says the Zamioculcas zamirola—often nicknamed the “ZZ” plant, is one that does well in very low light conditions. “This is a beautiful plant, and this plant is also very low light. Doesn’t matter if it has humidity or not. You only have to water it once a week, so it’s very low-maintenance, and it’s a plant that’s rich and shiny.”</p><h3>What's the easiest indoor plant to grow?</h3><p>Orozco-Encio recommends succulents as a low-maintenance plant for shady indoor rooms. “These are some of my favorites because they’re little, they’re tiny, they do well in low light, and they’re perfect for small spaces, or rooms like a bathroom or office. Succulents are from the cactus family. They are usually from two to eight inches. This kind of plant is very grateful. They are super low-maintenance. The less you do to them, the happier they are. So you can water them about every two weeks, some customers go 20 days without watering and they still look perfect. So if you travel a lot, this is the perfect plant for you because you don’t have to take care of it or pamper it too much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lmaOxsLvRZqelmZ6pwG6yzqtkpaenYrmqs8etZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-indoor-plants-for-low-light.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-indoor-plants-for-low-light.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-indoor-plants-for-low-light.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-indoor-plants-for-low-light.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-indoor-plants-for-low-light.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-indoor-plants-for-low-light.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-rey-mysterio-make-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-rey-mysterio-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Rey Mysterio Make?
