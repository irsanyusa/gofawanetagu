Thereafter, we started engaging in occasional chatting on different social media platforms, and I hoped <strong>eagerly</strong> for the desires to keep burning.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Gbenga is a nice and <strong>dashing</strong> young man, a little bit <strong>pompous</strong> if I may add, but it didn’t really matter so much because most of our men are raised to be <strong>entitled</strong>.</p><p><strong>Our First Date</strong></p><p>Few weeks after Easter, Gbenga decided to create time for us to meet. It was a very hot Saturday, I was so <strong>lazy</strong> to go out because I didn’t have enough money to get <strong>a taxi.</strong> Gbenga kept on <strong>buzzing</strong> my phone and then, it <strong>struck</strong> me; if he really needs to see me, why the hell shouldn’t he <strong>assist</strong> with transportation.</p><p>So, I decided to write him up on <strong>WhatsApp</strong> to let him decide whether or not he was going to pay the cab driver when I arrive his location. <strong>Fortunately</strong>, he agreed even though deep down he may have had his <strong>reservations</strong> about paying a <strong>girl’s transport</strong> fare. It is like a norm in <strong>Lagos,</strong> especially when the guy knows how hard the economy is, they still <strong>shame girls</strong> who ask for assistance once in a while for minor things.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Unlike most girls, I didn’t care. I understood quite well, the <strong>difference</strong> between <strong>a good girl and a naïve</strong> one. I needed to lay down the <strong>rules</strong>, it wasn’t easy, but I embraced a huge amount of <strong>courage</strong> and I was able to <strong>pull off</strong> whatever deal I had in mind. I was really <strong>audacious</strong>, and as you’ll know, most men see “<strong>brave girls</strong>” as disrespectful and mean.</p><p><strong>Gbenga’s House</strong></p><p>A few hours later, I arrived his place. He <strong>descended</strong> from the balcony, from where he has been watching our car drive in. After paying the driver, he pulled me a little closer, leaned forward for a hug. His little boy was somewhat <strong>excited</strong> down there, and of course, Gbenga couldn’t <strong>hide</strong> it from the protruding bump <strong>bulging</strong> out of his blue pants.</p><p>Meanwhile, before agreeing to visit him that day, I’d already known that it wasn’t going to be an ordinary visit. And so, I laid down a few rules;</p><ul class=list><li>He must have a condom. Even though I had a spare in my handbag, as always.</li><li>There must be power supply, not minding the source. At least, if one must have sex, there should be some sort of comfort to make the act worthwhile.</li><li>He mustn’t have any friends in his place while we’re together. It is not a good thing because, it creates a sort of discomfort for a girl, especially after being behind closed doors for hours. Walking out of the room with some inquisitive eyes staring at you, is a deal breaker.</li><li>Phones must be put on silence mode. No distraction required, it’s supposed to be a bonding time for two adults.</li><li>And there should be water and beverages in the fridge</li><li>All these few rules, plus he has to get me a cab to take me home afterwards, because “a girl needs to be treated like a queen”.</li></ul><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, we <strong>proceeded</strong> into the living room, it was a beautiful apartment with exquisite interior décor. He obviously had good taste and a <strong>knack</strong> for good music, and slowly I found myself imagining things way beyond this date.</p><p>I felt the need to explore in my mind, there was so much to imagine and I just let myself breath in the fresh <strong>lavender fragrance</strong> that buzzed through the little <strong>eyelet</strong> of the bathroom door. It felt like a place I could rest my <strong>head</strong>, and that one place I could recreate the <strong>picture</strong> I once drew about friendship. And like a <strong>burst</strong> of bubbles, I was awaken by his warm grip on my <strong>naked</strong> shoulder, and then, he whispered faintly like we were playing <strong>hide and seek</strong>…. I made something small for us to chew on, while we talk.</p><p><strong>The Supposed Talk</strong></p><p>Please, come with me! And without doubts, I followed him like a <strong>sheep</strong> who has just found its way back to safety. We talked <strong>endlessly</strong>, and I must say, it was a good talk. I realised we hadn’t even touched the <strong>Small Chops and Asun, </strong>we were just busy sipping on the <strong>Chapman juice</strong> served on the rock. It was so chilled that my nipples a<strong>ttested </strong>to it. They became round, and as hard as a gumball <strong>revealing</strong> themselves without <strong>hesitation</strong> to the erected image seated before me.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Are you cold? He asked with <strong>penetrable</strong> eye contact, I <strong>shrugged</strong> a bit and replied! The snacks are getting <strong>cold</strong>, we should probably<strong> pounce</strong> on them before they lose their value. Gbenga looked firmly into my eyes and said with a smile “these lips that I’m yet to <strong>sip</strong> on, has a lifetime value” Its better we focus on getting them <strong>warmed</strong> up….. Oh! <strong>Come closer</strong> baby, you’re so damn beautiful….</p><p><strong>The Romance</strong></p><p>I felt his lips gently <strong>caressing</strong> mine, like the slow motion used in <strong>erotic</strong> movies. I started to feel as though I’d been <strong>sedated</strong>? But on the <strong>contrary</strong>, that was just me trying to get out of my own head in order to get in the moment. His <strong>touches</strong> were mild and <strong>breath-taking</strong>, his tender hands <strong>fondled</strong> my <strong>breasts</strong> and without a second thought, he unhooked my bra.</p><p>I didn’t ask him to stop, in fact it was something I’d<strong> envisaged</strong> for weeks. It had to be done, at least, I needed to convince myself that he’d be as good in bed as his <strong>appearance</strong> revealed. I was having it, without <strong>hesitation</strong> my tongue <strong>toured</strong> the walls of his amazing cavity. As a good kisser, you’d probably give me that, I would be the go-to girl should you ever want to sponsor a kissing competition. Lol…</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It was finally happening…..he laid me down gently as he took off the last piece of cloth left on his body. He let his <strong>tongue</strong> travel my entire body until he finally let it settle on my <strong>pussy</strong>. Oh wow, I was dripping wet, <strong>my juice</strong> was all over. And I could hear the juicy “flicky-flick-sound” of my pussy as his fingers thrusted, it was an <strong>overwhelming</strong> pleasure, so much that I moaned gently with his name on my lips.</p><p>I could wait no longer! I was ready to welcome him home, so I pulled up his <strong>half covered</strong> face of <strong>pussy</strong><strong>juice</strong> onto my <strong>boobs</strong>. And i let him<strong> suckle</strong> on them for a bit, I was literally in the clouds by this time. Part of me was already making plans for another round, when I <strong>flipped</strong> him over and walked my mouth to his <strong>dick</strong>.</p><p>Wawu!! It turned out, his “little G” down there had a lot of muscles. I mouthed him a little bit more before<strong> riding</strong> him. Oh boy! I was mad with <strong>pleasure</strong>, Gbenga decided to change position by laying me face down. And like Usain Bolt, he <strong>thrusted</strong> ideally from behind my two huge <strong>protruding</strong> butt, and I went gaga in <strong>ecstasy</strong>.</p><p>I <strong>climaxed</strong> just about the same time he did, and we just laid there like two <strong>exhausted</strong> adults panting with smiley faces. It was just what I needed to check off my <strong>bucket list</strong>…..Ah, I finally found the <strong>sex</strong> partner for me. I smacked his face warmly and whispered to him <strong>erotically</strong>….. Mehn!! Gbenga, you’ve got “<strong>a-good-bad-boy-down-there</strong>”. Oh yea? We should probably engage in more of this! He replied.</p><p>Thank you for reading my story……</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Written by</strong><strong>Joyous Akhivbareme</strong></p><p>Joyous Akhivbareme.
