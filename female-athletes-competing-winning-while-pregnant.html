And when she <a href=#>announced</a> her pregnancy to the world last week, social media users pointed to that victory as further <a href=# rel=noopener>proof</a> of her status as the “greatest of all time.” Others <a href=# rel=noopener>questioned</a> how a pregnant woman could <a href=# rel=noopener>accomplish</a> such a feat.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Williams is far from the first professional athlete to compete and win while pregnant. Beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jennings <a href=# rel=noopener>won</a> her third gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics while five weeks pregnant. Canadian curler Kristie Moore <a href=# rel=noopener>took home</a> a silver medal at 2010 Olympics while five months pregnant. Malaysian shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi <a href=# rel=noopener>competed</a> at the 2012 Olympics while eight months pregnant, and Alysia Montaño <a href=# rel=noopener>ran</a> the 800-meter race at the 2014 U.S. track and field championships while eight months pregnant. They weren’t the <a href=# rel=noopener>only ones</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just last year, runner Sarah Brown made <a href=# rel=noopener>headlines</a> after announcing that she planned to attempt to make the U.S. Olympic team less than four months after giving birth to her first daughter. She trained throughout her pregnancy and then returned just one week after giving birth. “The pregnancy was unexpected, and I had some goals that I wanted to achieve before finding out,” Brown told <i>Motto</i>. “There was no reason why I shouldn’t keep trying.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But her decision to keep on training, which she made in consultation with doctors and her husband, was met with some criticism. “There were people reaching out with support,” Brown, who ultimately <a href=# rel=noopener>didn’t make</a> the 2016 roster, said. “And there were people also calling me crazy and saying what I was doing was unhealthy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2015, the International Olympic Committee <a href=# rel=noopener>gathered</a> sixteen experts from around the world to explore research and recommendations for athletes during pregnancy and after childbirth. Their subsequent report, released in 2016, <a href=# rel=noopener>found</a><b> </b>that it’s completely safe for women to keep training as they were before — so long as they adapt to the needs of their own body as it changes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is individual and depends on sports,” Kari Bø, a professor at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and one of the report’s authors, told Motto. “For example, a rhythmic gymnast would probably not be able to continue with back bending after their first trimester, while someone who participates in orienteering would be able to walk or jog in the forest until birth.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Earlier this month, seven-time Olympic medalist <a href=#>Dana Vollmer</a> swam the 50-meter freestyle at a national <a href=# rel=noopener>meet</a> while six months pregnant with her second child. “I knew I definitely wasn’t going to go as fast as I was going into Rio, but that wasn’t the goal,” Vollmer told Motto. “Nobody cared what time I got or what place I went. I was having fun just competing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I need goals. I’ve always known that about myself and that doesn’t change just because I’m pregnant,” she said. “So, setting the goal of wanting to compete at the Mesa meet was motivation for me to keep working out while pregnant.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The swimmer says that she was overjoyed with the response she got following the race. “I had so many people writing me on social media talking about marathons they did or continuing to swim or doing different races,” she said. “It’s amazing how strong pregnant women are and what we’re able to do.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though elite athletes — like many other career women — are able to balance pregnancy and subsequent motherhood with their careers just fine, older athletes say that hasn’t always been the norm. Hall of fame tennis player <a href=# rel=noopener>Gigi Fernández</a>, who won 17 <a href=# rel=noopener>Grand Slam doubles titles</a>, has publicly <a href=# rel=noopener>spoken</a> out about her struggles with infertility after delaying motherhood to focus on her career. “As athletes, you’re so focused on performance and you train very intensely. I would skip periods,” Fernández told <i>Motto</i>. “It was a very difficult time in my life.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fernández, who retired from her sport in 1997 and now coaches, eventually did become pregnant with the help of <a href=#>IVF</a> and now encourages younger female athletes to freeze their eggs. “I think that there’s a time and a place for everything,” she said. “Our athletic careers aren’t forever — you have to do it while you’re young. But at some point, if you want to be a mother, you have to take a break and focus on that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1997, basketball star Sheryl Swoopes announced that she was pregnant before the inaugural season of the WNBA, which she was widely expected to be the star of. Swoopes <a href=# rel=noopener>returned</a> to her sport six weeks later, which — while probably not a surprise to most women — was unusual for female athletes at the time. “I don’t know if anyone thought that was possible until [Sheryl] did it,” WNBA player Tina Thompson <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> in a documentary about Swoopes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as evidenced by Williams, Brown, Vollmer and others, competing and training while pregnant is totally doable. “Pregnancy isn’t a disability,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Bill Moreau</a>, the managing director of sports medicine for the U.S. Olympic Committee, <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> NBC in 2012. Still, we have a ways to go before a pregnant athlete excelling at her job will be commonplace rather than cause for excitement, questions or scrutiny.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After all, Vollmer and Brown, who both have their sights set on making the 2020 Olympic team in their sports, are just pursuing their careers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m a better mother because I run and I’m able to take that time for myself and go after something that’s important to me. I’m a better runner because I’m a mother because at the end of the day, I have someone who I can go home to who will love me regardless of what happens on the track,” Brown said. “I’m showing my daughter that it’s important to go after what you want.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2Vsf3WAjp%2BcppmcmnqiwMelnK2do2KwsLnPnquippdixKq6zaKloGWnnbatsYypqZ6fnpa7tXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffemale-athletes-competing-winning-while-pregnant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffemale-athletes-competing-winning-while-pregnant.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffemale-athletes-competing-winning-while-pregnant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffemale-athletes-competing-winning-while-pregnant.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffemale-athletes-competing-winning-while-pregnant.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffemale-athletes-competing-winning-while-pregnant.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./33540-how-religious-are-british-people.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./33540-how-religious-are-british-people.html>How religious are British people?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./captain-america-4-brave-new-world-set-photo-1235634314.html>Captain America 4 Retitled Brave New World, Drops First Look at Anthony Mackie and</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./captain-america-4-brave-new-world-set-photo-1235634314.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
