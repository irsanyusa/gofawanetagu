This is the first time the text has been published in its entirety.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 1: UN speech and New York</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first thing I see when I enter the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City is Roxy. My dog. The two of us are projected onto a large screen which apparently is part of an international art exhibition. When I see her brown labrador eyes it almost feels as if she was right here with me. Suddenly I’m reminded of how much I miss her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today is Sept. 23, 2019, and it’s now been 7 weeks since I boarded the train in Stockholm and began my journey. I have no clue of how and when I’m going to get back home. 3 weeks have passed since the boat Malizia sailed into New York City’s harbour and left the peaceful, constrained life on the ocean. After 14 days at sea we sailed past the Statue of Liberty, stepped ashore in Manhattan and took the red subway line uptown towards Central Park. My sea legs were shaking and all the impressions from people, scents, and noises became almost impossible to take in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_12.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The time in New York has been surreal. If the media attention was big in Europe, it’s nothing compared to how it is here. A year ago the thought of seeing pictures of my dog inside the UN would have been unthinkable. Now it’s nothing strange at all. I see myself everywhere. Just the night before one of my speeches had been projected onto the facade of the UN building. But luckily I completely lack an interest in such things. If you would care about this kind of attention, then you’d probably develop a self-image that is far from sane.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s very hard to move inside the giant labyrinth of this building. Presidents, prime ministers, kings, and princesses, all come up to me to chat. People recognize me and suddenly see their opportunity to get a selfie which later they can post on their Instagram – with the caption #savetheplanet. Perhaps it makes them forget the shame of their generation letting all future generations down. I guess maybe it helps them to sleep at night.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the greenroom, sitting with the other speakers, I try to read through my speech, but I constantly get interrupted by people who want to do small talk and take selfies. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres steps in. We chat for a bit, just like I’ve learnt that you’re supposed to do. I fill up my red water bottle and sit down again. Then it’s Chancellor Angela Merkel’s turn to come up, congratulate, take a picture and ask whether it’s ok for her to post it on social media. A queue starts forming. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn’t quite make it before it’s time for the event to start.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The annual UN General Assembly week in New York City is always a big global event, but this year it was a bit extra special since the secretary general had decided that the focus would be exclusively on the climate. The expectations are huge. It has been promoted as a ‘now-or-never’ moment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Almost all of the world’s leaders are sitting in the audience, but it’s only those with specific so-called “solutions” who have received an invitation to address the General Assembly.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The event begins with a very ambitious digital sound- and lightshow. The volume is way too high. I’m standing by the backdrop covering my ears.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">”We do not accept these odds.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That is what the speech was about, <a href=# rel=noopener>if you read it in full</a>. And it of course alludes to our remaining carbon budget. But the only message that seems to have resonated is ”how dare you?”.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve never been angry in public. I’ve barely even been angry at home. But this time I’ve decided that I have to make the most out of the speech. To address the United Nations General Assembly is something you probably only get to do once in your lifetime. So this is it. I need to say things I will be able to stand by for the rest of my life, so that I won’t look back in 60-70 years from now and regret that I didn’t say enough, that I held back. So I choose to let my emotions take control.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the subway home I see that many in the car around me are watching the speech on their phones. Some come forward to congratulate me. Someone suggests that we should celebrate. But I don’t understand what their congratulations are for, and I understand even less what we’re supposed to be celebrating.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet another meeting is over. And all that is left are empty words.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 2: Washington D.C.</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Who is the adult in the room? That question has been asked over and over again during the last year. But this question reaches a whole new level when I end up standing in front of the food court in the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. Fast food chains. Hamburgers, candy and ice cream stores. Dunkin Donuts. Baskin Robbins. Here you find the most powerful policymakers in the world sitting in their suits, while drinking pink milkshake, eating junk food and candy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the week leading up to the UN General Assembly meeting I spend a few days in the nation’s capital. I use the opportunity to do the kind of things you can do when in Washington D.C. Like visit museums, protest outside the White House, speak in the United States Congress, and stuff like that. But most of the time I meet with politicians.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It gets a bit repetitive after a while. But in a way it almost feels like coming home, since politicians are pretty much the same no matter where you are in the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I urge them to listen to the science and act now before it’s too late. They say that they think it’s so amazing that I’m so active and committed, and that when I grow up I too can become a politician and make a real difference in the world. I then explain that when I’ve grown up and finished my education it will be too late to act if we are to stay below the 1.5°C – or even 2°C – target. After that I talk through some of the figures and numbers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C report. Then they laugh nervously and start talking about something else.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A group of maybe 20 young climate activists gather inside the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s office. Our group mostly consists of representatives from indigenous peoples in North- and South America. From First Nation tribes and the Amazon rainforest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the wall hangs a big portrait of Abraham Lincoln. The atmosphere during the meeting is awkward at best. It is as if two entirely different worlds collide. Worlds separated by hundreds of years of injustices, structural and systematic racism, oppression and genocide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At last a young activist asks to speak. Her name is Tokata Iron Eyes and she lives in Pine Ridge, an Indian reservation in South Dakota, one of the poorest and most socially vulnerable communities in the entire United States.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“How do you think it feels for us to sit here in this room with that man looking down from that painting?” she says and points to Abraham Lincoln.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speaker Pelosi apologies if anyone has been offended but explains that he was a great man who has meant so much for their country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He wanted my people dead”, Tokata says. She’s referring to the <a href=# rel=noopener>executions of Dakota Indians</a> ordered by Lincoln in 1862. “To sit here in this room with that painting… It’s just so difficult” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I try to picture things from her perspective. We fight for climate justice, but how can any justice be achieved when the social and racial injustices have never been officially acknowledged in the public eye in so many parts of the world?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That same day I’m called to testify in the U.S. Congress. But it just feels wrong. What am I supposed to do or say there? I want the people in power to listen to the science, not to me. But after a lot of hesitation and consideration I figured out a way. I asked whether I could borrow a computer. I print out a copy of the IPCC’s 1.5°C report. I was ready to submit my testimony.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Afterwards I take the metro to Tenleytown and walk the 45 minute stroll to the house we’ve borrowed. The walk stretches through some of the most beautiful neighbourhoods you can possibly imagine. Every house is like a miniature castle straight out of a fairytale. Outside one of the biggest houses there’s a woman standing with her daughter, who is around the age of five. “It’s you!” the mother says when she sees me. “Can I take a picture of you together with my daughter?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Of course!” I answer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I walk away she turns facing the girl. “Greta is a climate activist, she explains. Maybe you’ll also become an activist when you grow up.” The mother says it in a way that makes climate activist appear as the most noble, cool thing in the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like a mix between a ballerina, a president, and an astronaut.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 3: The science</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My message is – and has always been – listen to the science, listen to the scientists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Which scientists?” you could of course argue. Within all scientific fields there’s a constant and never-ending debate. That’s what science is about. And climate crisis deniers and delayers love this angle. To spread doubt about whether there’s actually consensus on the scientific grounds of the climate crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That argument can be used in almost all other issues, but it’s no longer possible to use here. The time for that has passed. The consensus is overwhelming. The debate around the global adoption and acceptance of the Paris Agreement and the IPCC reports is over. So what do those two things actually mean?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Paris, the world’s governments committed themselves to keeping the global temperature rise to “well below 2°C”. But in the latest update from the IPCC – the <a href=# rel=noopener>SR1.5 report</a> – scientists underline that 2°C is not a safe level. We have today already passed about 1.2°C of global heating, and in their report they instead stress the importance of limiting the warming to below 1.5°C. And that is to give us the best possible chance to avoid passing so-called tipping points, and start irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So where do we start? Well I’d suggest that we do precisely what all the world’s governments have committed to do in the Paris Agreement. Which is to follow the current best available science.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And that, among other places, we find on <a href=# rel=noopener>page 108, chapter 2 in the IPCC’s SR1.5 report</a>. Right there it says that on Jan. 1 2018 we had 420 Gt CO2 left to emit globally to have a 66% chance of staying below the 1.5° target. We emit about 42 Gt CO2 every year, including land use such as forestry and agriculture. So today we’re soon already down to lower than 300 Gt of CO2 left to emit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That is the equivalent of less than 7.5 years of today’s ‘business as usual’ emissions until that budget completely runs out. This is the carbon budget which gives us the best odds to achieve the 1.5° target. Yes, you heard it right, less than 7.5 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Do you remember the London Olympics? ‘Gangnam Style’ or the first Hunger Games movie? Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That’s the amount of time we are talking about.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But even these figures are very watered down. They include almost no tipping points or feedback loops, nor the global aspect of equity in the Paris Agreement, nor already locked-in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Most IPCC scenarios also assume that future generations will be able to suck hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere with technologies that don’t exist on the scale required, and that very likely never will in time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I will try to explain more about what these aspects mean later on. But if you read between the lines you realise that we are facing the need to make changes which are unprecedented in human history.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One reason why the climate and ecological crisis is so hard to communicate is that there’s no magical date when everything is beyond saving. You cannot predict how many people’s lives will be lost, or exactly how our societies will be affected. There are of course countless estimations and calculations which predict what could happen—one more catastrophic than the other—but they almost exclusively focus on a very limited area and almost never take into account the whole picture. We therefore must learn to read between the lines. Just like in any other emergency.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But these are at least the basics. Even if these figures are way too generous they are still the most reliable roadmap available today. They are what we should be referring to.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And the fact that the responsibility to communicate them falls on me and other children should be seen for exactly what it is – a failure beyond all imagination.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 4: Roadtrip</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Three days after my speech in the UN I leave New York City. The last few days everything got a bit too much with all the people and the attention. It feels like a huge relief to move out of the house on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and say goodbye to our host for the last month.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve taken a sabbatical year from school to be able to travel to Santiago de Chile, where the UN’s yearly climate conference, the COP 25, is going to be held. I have no idea how to get there, all I know is that, in order to reach Santiago in time, I’ve got to get to Los Angeles by November 1st. So now awaits 5 weeks of constant traveling. My dad and I leave Manhattan behind us and drive north in an electric car that we’ve borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We travel through spectacular landscapes, past mountains, ravines, glaciers, prairies, deserts, swamps. We see the autumn coloured leaves of New England, the forests of Quebec, the lakes in Minnesota, buffalo herds in Wyoming, the redwood trees in Oregon, red rock formations in Arizona and the cotton fields of Alabama.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We switch between the radio stations. The choices are almost only Christian pop and country music. Most of the time it’s just the two of us, but sometimes we are accompanied by journalists or people we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_13.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Every Friday I continue to strike wherever I find myself to be at that moment. Denver, Iowa City, Charlotte, Rapid City, Edmonton, Vancouver, Los Angeles. Everywhere lots of people show up, people of all ages. But nothing beats Montreal where half a million people came out on the streets.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In South Dakota we are stopped by a policeman. He looks just like a caricature from an American movie, with mirrored shades, cowboy hat and all. He asks us where we are going. I say Santiago. Then he asks if we’ve got any large amounts of “dollars, weapons or dead bodies in the car?” We answer no, and continue across the Missouri river, over the prairies, the Badlands and the Rocky Mountains.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the car is charging we walk around the alleys of small towns, shopping malls, suburbs, petrol stations, farms, industrial and residential areas. Wherever I go, people come up to talk and take selfies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We wake up at 7 a.m. and drive until we get tired in the evening. We buy food wherever there’s food to buy, but it’s not that easy when you’re on the road and you’re vegan. It ends up being mostly canned food, beans, french fries, bananas and bread.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the nights we either sleep in motels or with people who open up their homes. Activists, scientists, authors, doctors, journalists, hippies, diplomats, movie stars, lawyers. We travel through 37 states in total. Every state has got a slogan on the cars’ license plates, but I make up my own. Like for instance:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">North Carolina: Where not even the vegetarian salad bars have vegetarian options.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alabama: Where the sunsets are pretty and the Christmas decorations are early.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Through the car window I can see the neverending coal trains in Nebraska and Montana, the oil wells in Colorado and California, abandoned factories in Indiana and Pennsylvania, 16-lane highways, endless parking lots and shopping malls, shopping malls, shopping malls. Through the tiny vents of big livestock trucks I look into the eyes of cows and pigs on their way to slaughterhouses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m stunned by the economic differences and social injustices which in many ways are an affront to all forms of human decency. I’m outraged by the oppression targeting especially indigenous, Black and Hispanic communities.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Every twenty minutes or so we pass fields where seemingly endless amounts of brand new RVs, motorboats, quad bikes and tractors are lined up for sale. Along the highways you see giant billboards with anti-abortion, anti-evolution and anti-science campaigns.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At night time the sky is lit by countless oil refineries sparkling in the dark, from north to south, from coast to coast.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Apart from a few wind power plants and solar panels there are no signs whatsoever of any sustainable transition, despite this being the richest country in the world. The debate is far behind Europe. We’re discussing free public transport and circular economy – here they don’t even have public health care or pavements for pedestrians to walk on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a petrol station in Texas I count to over 40 different kinds of coffee. I try to add up the number of different sorts of soft drinks as well, but I lose count around 200.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An older man in a cowboy hat comes up to me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m a big fan,” he says, before he walks across the parking lot, steps inside his giant pickup truck and drives on down the highway.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 5: The beetle</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The only place that anyone has ever discouraged me from visiting is Alberta, Canada. The state of Alberta is one of the western world’s largest oil producers and its main claim to fame is probably being home to the tar sands. The tar sands are an area bigger than the whole of England where oil companies have spent the last 60 years extracting oil straight from the soil. A process with a enormous ecological footprint.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alberta has a very powerful and highly criticized oil lobby that is well known for its harsh methods to silence anyone they consider a threat to their industry. And I’m definitely considered a threat to them. On several occasions I need to call for police protection when the level of threats and the sheer harassments become too serious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_14.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the morning of Oct.21 I’m traveling through the spectacular Canadian landscapes with a film crew from the BBC, heading for the Jasper National Park. Magnificent pine forests stretching out as far as the eye can see. It reminds me of home. Except for the fact that many trees here aren’t green, their needles are either brown or have been lost entirely. It looks very strange. I assume they must be American larch trees, since those trees lose their needles in the autumn.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“No, unfortunately those aren’t Larch trees,” says the biologist Brenda Shepherd as she walks me round the national park. She shakes her head as she approaches one of the brown, pine trees and points to a hole through the bark. Though the hole seeps something that looks like solidified resin.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Here you can see how the tree has tried to defend itself,” she says. “But it’s useless, it will soon be dead.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How many trees in this area would you say are affected? I ask.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“About 50%.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I can’t seem to get my head around what she just said. “50%?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Somewhere around there,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The term ”tipping point” can be hard to understand but this the most clear and obvious example that I that I have come across myself. The mountain pine beetle exists across the North American continent. Every winter the temperature here drops to very low levels. Much colder than in Sweden, for instance. And since only a very small percentage of this species survives in that temperature for a certain number of days, this has never been a problem in the past. But in the last few decades this area has seen a significant level of heating. Canada – as well as other countries close to the poles – has seen a rate of warming about <a href=# rel=noopener>twice as fast as the rest of the world</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, the temperature rises and all of a sudden we find ourselves on the other side of an invisible border. Suddenly almost the entire population of this beetle survives the winter. And we have passed a tipping point. A point of no return which releases several so-called feedback loops: self-reinforcing, often irreversible, chain reactions. And since the local ecosystem completely lacks the ability to adjust to the new reality, the consequences become extremely visible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tree after tree is attacked by the mountain pine beetle and dies shortly thereafter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Needles to say, the effects on the local environment are disastrous.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But, unfortunately, what happens in the Canadian Rockies doesn’t stay in the Canadian Rockies. These mechanisms are global.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 6: Tipping points</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The day after my encounter with the mountain pine beetle, we have an appointment with the glaciologist John Pomeroy. His team of researchers from the University of Saskatchewan has offered to bring me up onto the Athabasca glacier.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Along the walk leading up to the glacier there are signs placed out by the side of the pathway. Every sign marks a certain year. John stops and points at one that says 1982. “That means that this is where the glacier began in that year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It looks quite strange as there is no sight of any nearby glacier whatsoever.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was around that time I started working here,” he continues. “Since then I have watched with my own eyes how the glacier has disappeared, meter by meter.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Due to global heating the Athabasca glacier has, in the <a href=# rel=noopener>last 125 years</a>, retreated 1.5 km and lost half its volume. According to the latest estimates, it’s currently withdrawing 5 metres every year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_15.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I was instructed to wear every piece of warm clothing that I have, since Katabatic winds – winds that form over glaciers – can be ruthless. And they weren’t exaggerating. Once we step onto the ice it gets almost impossible to move forward, let alone to stand up straight. There’s a heavy snowfall passing by, reminding us that the full force of the long Canadian winter is about to arrive any day now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We struggle on in our borrowed boots, using ski poles to support our balance and weight. When we reach a place John considers good enough, he stops, takes off his backpack and starts unpacking his gear. He takes measurements while explaining the procedures step by step.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then he starts chipping into the ice. He breaks off a piece and gives it to me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If you look carefully, you see it’s full of small black dots. That’s soot,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Where does the soot come from?, I ask.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s from the wildfires that burn here every year. The woods lose a lot of their resilience to the fires as there are so many dead trees all over the forest that become like firewood.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I realise he’s referring to the trees I saw yesterday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When there’s this much soot then the entire glacier turns grey,” he continues. “And since a dark surface absorbs more heat than a white one, it means the glacier will melt even faster. It’s a feedback loop. A part of a chain reaction.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I ask whether this glacier can be saved or not. He shakes his head.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“No, this one has already passed its tipping point and there’s nothing we can do. We estimate that it – along with countless other glaciers – will be gone completely within this century. The world’s glaciers are called the third polar ice cap. Imagine all the people that depend on these glaciers as their source of drinking water. And as if that wasn’t enough, we have now gotten used to – and built our infrastructure around a very high water flow, since the melting process obviously has been way higher than it normally is. That will make it even harder for us to adjust when it starts to run dry.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How many people are relying on the glaciers in this area for their drinking water, I ask.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The entire western North America,” he replies. “But the same process is happening all over the world. The Andes, The Alps. And above all in Asia, where up to 2 billion people depend on the natural melting process of the glaciers in Himalaya for their very survival.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, in short: the temperature increases, the damaging mountain pine beetle survives the winter and dramatically increases in population. The trees die and turn into wildfire fuel which intensifies the wildfires even further. The soot from those fires makes the surface of the glaciers turn darker and the melting process speeds up even faster.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is a textbook example of a reinforcing chain reaction, which in itself is just a small part of a much larger holistic pattern connected to our emissions of greenhouse gases.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are countless other tipping points and chain reactions. Some have not yet happened. And some are very much a reality already today. Such as the release of methane due to thawing permafrost or other phenomena linked to deforestation, dying coral reefs, weakening or changing ocean currents, algae growing on the Antarctic ice, increasing ocean temperatures, changes in monsoon patterns and so on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another overlooked factor is the already built in additional warming hidden by life threatening air pollution, this means that once we stop burning fossil fuels we can expect to see an already locked in warming, <a href=# rel=noopener>perhaps as high as 0.5-1.1°C</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s all part of an infinite chain of events that constantly trigger and create new events. And new events. And new events. There just doesn’t seem to be an end.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 7: Paradise</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The wall is completely covered by posters. Each one contains a photo of an animal. Dogs, cats, bunnies. On each and every one there is a big headline that spells out the word MISSING. A handful has FOUND handwritten across the picture, but the vast majority remain MISSING.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The wall belongs to the local primary school in the town of Paradise, California. On Nov. 8, 2018 Paradise was almost completely destroyed by a devastating wildfire. The pictures on the school wall represent all the pets that went missing in the fire. This wall became a place where the owners collectively displayed their last hope of finding their pets alive. But, needless to say, most of the animals remain MISSING.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fire in Paradise destroyed almost 19,000 buildings. 85 people lost their lives, if you exclude other causes of death after the fire. Before the fire 27, 000 people lived in Paradise. Today that number is down to around 2000. The town became a symbol of how climate breakdown is affecting us in the global north already today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">California has always had a natural fire season, just like Australia, Brazil and many other places. But over recent years that season has grown considerably longer and the fires have become more frequent and devastating. Higher temperatures, less rainfall and stronger winds are some of the changing factors that together make up for a deadly combination when it comes to wildfires.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Walking around in Paradise is almost like being in a ghost town. I’m here with the BBC to talk to one of the survivors of the 2018 fire. He guides us around the area that used to be his neighborhood. He points at empty spaces and tells us what used to be there. Houses and gardens in the lush, green outskirts of town.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That was a car,” he says and points to a lump of metal, lying on a burnt out driveway. The temperature in the fire sometimes got so high that cars started to melt. Suddenly he stops.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This used to be my house.” He looks at an open field as if there still was a house standing there. It’s almost as if he’s hallucinating, since all that is left is a mailbox and the remains of power lines and sewage pipes, sticking out of the red soil.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fact that the climate crisis is already affecting people today is hardly something new. Even though it would sometimes seem like it, judging by the ongoing discourse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We often hear that we need to act for the sake of our children. That the future living conditions will get significantly worsened unless we act now. And that is of course true. But it seems like we keep forgetting that large numbers of people around the world are dying already today. And when I say that I’m not primarily talking about in places like California.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ones who are and will be hit the hardest are the same as in most other crises. The poorest and the most vulnerable. Those who are already suffering from other injustices. Namely, people in developing countries, and above all women and children. Since they are the ones with the least resources, living in the most vulnerable parts of the global society.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The UN predicts that by the year 2050 there will be up to 1 billion climate refugees in the world. I wonder, what will it take for us to start facing these issues and begin to ask the uncomfortable questions?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Sweden we live our lives as if we had <a href=# rel=noopener>4.2 planet earths</a>. Our annual carbon footprint is approximately 11 tonnes of CO2 per person, if we include consumption. That can be compared to India’s 1.7 tonnes per capita. Or Kenyas 0.3 tonnes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On average the CO2 emissions from one single Swede annually is the equivalent of 110 people from Mali in West Africa. So if there is any truth to the claim – popular in Western societies – that quote ”there are too many people in the world” then wouldn’t that only refer to ourselves, living extremely high carbon lifestyles in the global north? And not the vast majority of the global population who are already living within the planetary boundaries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But my experience from all such arguments is that they are only used to seek further excuses to go on living the unsustainable life that we consider to be our right.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis. The ones who’ll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The global aspect of equity and climate justice make up the very heart of the Paris Agreement. Developed countries have signed up to lead the way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And this is so that people in developing countries can have a chance to raise their living standards and to build some of the infrastructure that we in the industrialized world already have. Such as roads, hospitals, schools, electricity, sewage systems and clean drinking water.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After our visit to Paradise we get back in the car and head towards the coast. We have been offered a stay for the night in a small house in a vineyard. But suddenly the phone rings and we find out that the entire vineyard has burnt to the ground in the wildfires currently raging through the California wine districts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We drive on towards San Francisco. As the evening falls the night sky turns red and you can feel the smoke from the fires in your nose.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 8: Media</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Wait, let me just record the interview.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The journalist grabs his iPhone out of the pocket of his way-too-thin coat. It is a cloudy, freezing day on Mynttorget in the old town of central Stockholm. But just like any other Friday a few dozen others and I have gathered here to stand outside and protest in front of the Swedish parliament. It does get a bit chilly standing there for 7 hours straight in a few windy degrees below zero.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He presses record and holds up the phone towards me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“So, why are you striking?” he asks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m striking for us to take the climate crisis seriously and treat it like a crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Yes, but what do you want the politicians to do?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I want them to listen to and act on the science, do what they have promised to do in the Paris Agreement and treat the crisis like a crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I can tell that I haven’t given him the answers he wanted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Yes, but what specifically?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I then start talking about carbon budgets he gives up and interrupts. He knows very well he won’t be able to use anything of what I’m now saying in his article. People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish and emotional.

The fact is that no one knows. There is no magic invention or political plan that will solve everything. Because how do you solve a crisis? How do you solve a war? How do you solve a pandemic without a vaccine?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The only way is to treat the climate crisis like you would treat any other crisis. To come together, gather all the experts, put other things aside and adapt to the new reality. To act as quickly and strongly as the situation allows.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If for instance there’s no vaccine available for a disease you invest all possible resources into developing one as soon as possible, while at the same time taking all other possible measures as well. In a crisis you act even if you don’t know exactly how you are going to solve the problem. In a crisis there’s no time to wait for specific answers and details. Because the answers have to be found along the way. In a crisis you need to put all cards on the table and think long term and holistically. The climate crisis doesn’t have a vaccine. We have to admit that we don’t know how we are going to solve it. Because if we would have known then it wouldn’t have been a crisis in the first place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are many who claim that people understand but repress the full meaning of the climate crisis, because the message is too depressing and difficult to handle. That would mean that we continue to do what we do, despite being fully aware of the devastating consequences of our actions. But that I refuse to believe, since this would mean that we humans are evil.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My experience however is that people understand much less about the climate crisis than you’d think. If there’s anything I’ve learnt from traveling around the world it is that the level of knowledge and awareness is close to nonexistent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve met many of the most powerful people in the world. And even among them pretty much everyone lacks even some of the most basic knowledge.

It’s pitch black outside and the car is still freezing. Rob Liddell, a documentarian with the BBC, and sailor Nikki Henderson are sitting in the back.

Rob has got the camera on his shoulder and is looking at us through the lens.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s dead silent inside the car.

We clear the harbor entrance heading for Chesapeake Bay and wave goodbye to all the people and TV crews who have gathered on the surrounding docks. There’s a strong wind coming from Northwest.

What if it should rather be “what should we stop doing to avoid a climate disaster”?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year – 2020 – the <a href=# rel=noopener>emission curve must be bent steeply downwards</a> if we are to still have even a small chance of achieving the goals world leaders have agreed to. And then it’s of course not going to be enough with a temporary and coincidental reduction of greenhouse gas emissions where the purpose has been to stop a pandemic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A common misconception about the climate crisis is that people think we need to reduce our emissions. But the fact is that if we are to keep the promise of the Paris Agreement, a reduction won’t be enough. We then need to reach a full stop of emissions within a couple of decades, and then quickly move on to negative figures.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are generally three ways of reducing emissions – apart from the most obvious, to replace current fossil energy with renewables, such as solar and wind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Number one is technical solutions. Techniques where you capture and store CO2 at the emitting source or directly out of the air. The problem here however is that the emissions need to drastically reduce now, and these techniques won’t exist at even close to scale in the foreseeable future. These plants are still prototypes. Believe me, I’ve myself visited two of the leading facilities in the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The second alternative is to use nature’s own ability to absorb and store carbon, which today often gets mistaken for only <a href=# rel=noopener>planting trees</a>. Despite the fact that the most efficient way most often is to just leave the forests and natural habitats be in the first place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A forest area the size of a football field is being cut down every second, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Global Forest Watch</a>. That is every second of every hour of every day. No tree planting in the world could compensate for that. And even if we miraculously decided to shut down the entire forestry industry and use all the available space in the world to plant trees, that still would <a href=# rel=noopener>only</a> compensate for a few years’ emissions at current rates.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The third option is the only method that is available at scale already today. And that is to simply stop doing certain things. But it is also the alternative which people seem to find the most unrealistic. Just the thought of us being in a crisis that we cannot buy, build or invest our way out of seems to create some kind of collective mental short circuit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then there’s of course a fourth way of doing it. And this is the procedure that undoubtedly has been the most successful one so far, when it comes to reducing emissions. And it is so-called “creative accounting”. To simply refrain from reporting the emissions, or move them somewhere else. To systematically sweep things under the carpet, lie, and blame someone else.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My own country Sweden is a textbook example. In our case this strategy means that over <a href=# rel=noopener>half</a> our emissions simply don’t exist on paper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_06.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Year after year people in power are allowed to appear in the media unchallenged and claim that Sweden’s emissions of greenhouse gases have decreased 20-30% since 1990. But the truth is that they <a href=# rel=noopener>haven’t</a> decreased at all, if you include consumption and international aviation and shipping. And obviously the statistics will look much better if you simply choose not to count everything.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But this is not unique to Sweden. The same approach is being used by pretty much everyone in the richer part of the world. Whether it being the EU, individual countries, states, cities or companies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We have simply moved our factories to different parts of the world where the labour is cheaper – and by doing so we also moved a significant part of our emissions overseas. And of course this is a very convenient solution for the global north, but since the biosphere doesn’t care about neither borders nor empty words, it doesn’t work as well in reality.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the real problem is that when it comes to the climate- and ecological emergency the people in power can today say basically whatever they want. They are practically guaranteed to not receive any follow up questions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The issue of nuclear power is still for example allowed to dominate the entire climate debate, even though science has concluded that it can – at best – only be a very risky, <a href=# rel=noopener>expensive</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>small</a> part of a much larger <a href=# rel=noopener>holistic</a> solution.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You can claim that we can achieve impossible results through so-called green investments, without having to explain how it will be done, or what the term “green” even means. Words like green, sustainable, ’net zero’, ‘environmentally friendly’, organic, ‘climate neutral’ and ‘fossil free’ are today so misused and watered down that they have pretty much lost all their meaning. They can imply everything from deforestation to aviation, meat- and car industries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And basically because the general level of public awareness is so low you can still get away with anything. No one is held accountable. It’s like a game. Whoever is best at packaging and selling their message wins. And since the truth is uncomfortable, unpopular and unprofitable, the truth doesn’t stand much of a chance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Moral, truth, long term- and holistic thinking seem to mean nothing to us. The emperors are naked. Every single one. It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 11: Corona pandemic</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year when I visited Davos I slept in a tent in 18° below zero. This year the organisers said that for security reasons I had to stay in a hotel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The night before the conference starts I catch the flu. So it was quite a relief that I wasn’t sleeping in a tent. I have to cancel most scheduled events, which is something I actually don’t mind at all, since I find social gatherings and meetings that don’t lead anywhere mostly just being a waste of time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So my stay is quite relaxing, but today I’m supposed to drag myself out the door for a meeting with the president of Switzerland. After that I’m going to go public with my plans about traveling to China. I’ve just received the official invitation to address the World Economic Forum conference which will most likely be held in Shenzhen, China sometime in the beginning of June. Visiting China is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and now it’s finally about to happen, that is, if the Chinese government will let me inside the country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But just as I’m about to walk out the door the Swiss president cancels, as she had to immediately go back to Zürich to attend an emergency meeting. Apparently developments around the new virus discovered in China are causing grave concern.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That was my first introduction to the coronavirus crisis. I immediately put my plans of visiting China on hold. It seemed to become less and less possible to travel there sometime this spring. Instead I start planning to follow up on some other invitations, to take the Trans Siberian railway via Vladivostok to South Korea and Japan. But as the situation escalates I of course have to abandon these plans as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_08.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So I use the upcoming weeks to travel around in Europe, continuing to work on the documentary together with the BBC. We visit Jokkmokk, London, Yorkshire, Zürich and the European parliament. I strike in Hamburg, Bristol and Brussels. It’s the beginning of March 2020 and the world is just about to be turned completely upside down. This weekend there are supposed to be big climate strikes in France. But right here a tipping point is passed. What was unquestionable the week before has now suddenly become unthinkable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the Fridays For Future movement we decide to cancel everything, without hesitation. People are dying. Many are losing their family members, loved ones as well as their economic stability. The consequences of this pandemic are catastrophic. A crisis is a crisis, and in a crisis we all have to take a few steps back and act for the greater good of each other and our society. In a crisis you adapt and change your behaviour. And indeed, this is what the world does, at record speed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So what was it that made these global structural changes possible in just a matter of hours?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Was it hope and inspiration that made us act so quickly during the corona pandemic? Something that most communication experts and news editors have claimed to be the only way forward to create change. Or was it perhaps something else?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s nothing positive about the corona crisis from a climate perspective. The changes made in our daily lives due to COVID-19 have extremely little similarity with the action needed for the climate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The corona tragedy of course has no long term positive effects on the climate, apart from one thing only: namely the insight into how you should perceive and treat an emergency. Because during the corona crisis we suddenly act with necessary force.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">International emergency meetings take place on a daily basis. Astronomical financial bailouts magically appear out of nowhere. Canceled events and tough restrictions make people change their behaviour and approach overnight.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The media completely transitions, puts other things on hold and almost exclusively reports about COVID-19, with daily press conferences and live coverage 24/7. All parts of society come together and politicians put their different views aside and cooperate for the greater good of everyone. Well – maybe not everyone and everywhere.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But broadly speaking, people in power from politics, business and finance are suddenly saying that they will do whatever it takes since “you can not put a price on a human life”.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those words and this treatment of the crisis opens up a whole new dimension. Because you see, every year at least 7 million people die from illnesses related to air pollution, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to the WHO</a>. Those are apparently people whose lives we can put a price on. Since they die from the wrong causes, and in the wrong parts of the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the corona pandemic policy makers repeat that we have to “listen to the science and the experts”. Well, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to the world’s leading scientists and experts on biodiversity</a>, the pandemic is likely to be followed by deadlier and more destructive diseases unless we halt the ceaseless destruction of natural habitats.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But these are not the scientists and experts they are referring to. Because long term sustainability doesn’t fit inside today’s economic and political systems.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Chapter 12: Hope</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the aftermath of the corona crisis there are many who claim that we need to use this as an opportunity. That when we restart the economy we must adopt a so-called “green recovery plan”. And of course it’s incredibly important that we invest our assets in sustainable projects, renewable energy, technical solutions and research. But we must not for one second believe that it will be even close to what is actually required. Or for that matter that the so called targets set out today would be ambitious enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If all countries were to actually go through with the emission reductions they have set as goals, we would still be heading for a catastrophic global temperature rise of at least <a href=# rel=noopener>3-4 degrees</a>. The people in power today have thus practically already given up on the possibility of handing over a decent future for coming generations. Given up without even trying.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It sounds terrible, I know. But in reality it is actually even worse. Because even if they want to act in line with what is needed – which actually sometimes is the case – they can’t. And that is because we are stuck in already written contracts and business agreements.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s just simple math.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=# rel=noopener>United Nations Production Gap Report</a> shows that the world’s planned fossil fuel production alone by the year 2030 accounts for 120% more than what would be consistent with the 1.5°C target. It just doesn’t add up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe we have to make it possible to tear up contracts and abandon existing deals and agreements, on a scale we can’t even begin to imagine today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And that alone requires a whole new way of thinking. Since those type of actions are not politically, economically or legally possible today. The climate- and ecological crisis can not be solved within today’s political and economic systems. That is no longer an opinion. That’s a fact.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I understand that all of this sounds uncomfortable and depressing. And I fully get why you as a politician or news editor choose to look away. But you must also realise that for us who actually have to live with the consequences for the rest of our lives, that’s a luxury that we can’t afford.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Recently <a href=# rel=noopener>a new scientific report</a> was published by scientists from Uppsala University and the Tyndall Centre in the UK. It shows that if rich countries like Sweden and the UK are to fulfill their commitments to the Paris Agreement’s well-below 2°C target they need to reduce their total national emissions of CO2 by 12-15% every year, starting now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course there’s no “green recovery plan” or “deal” in the world that alone would be able to achieve such emission cuts. And that’s why the whole “green deal” debate ironically risks doing more harm than good, as it sends a signal that the changes needed are possible within today’s societies. As if we could somehow solve a crisis without treating it like a crisis. A lot may have happened in the last two years, but the changes and level of awareness required are still nowhere in sight.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Things may look dark and hopeless, but I’m telling you there is hope. And that hope comes from the people, from democracy, from you. From the people who more and more themselves are starting to realize the absurdity of the situation. The hope does not come from politics, business or finance. And that’s not because politicians or businesspeople are evil. But because what is needed right now simply seems to be too uncomfortable, unpopular and unprofitable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Public opinion is what runs the free world, and the public opinion necessary is today nonexisting, the level of knowledge is too low.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But there are signs of change, of awakening. Just take the metoo movement, blacklivesmatter or the schoolstrike movement for instance. It’s all interconnected. We have passed a social tipping point, we can no longer look away from what our society has been ignoring for so long. Whether it is sustainability, equality, or justice.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From a sustainability point of view all political and economic systems have failed. But humanity has not yet failed. The climate and ecological emergency is not primarily a political crisis. It is an existential crisis, completely based on scientific facts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The evidence is there. The numbers are there. We cannot get away from that fact. Nature doesn’t bargain and you cannot compromise with the laws of physics. And either we accept and understand the reality as it is, or we don’t. Either we go on as a civilisation or we don’t.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Doing our best is no longer good enough. We must now do the seemingly impossible. And that is up to you and me. Because no one else will do it for us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greta_Thunberg_time_03.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGZog3mAjqCpnqyRYsGpwc2bnKufXZm2or7YZpqloZ2WwaZ5wqugrKGjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgreta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgreta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgreta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgreta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgreta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgreta-thunberg-diary-climate-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bridgerton-season-3-differences-from-book.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bridgerton-season-3-differences-from-book.html>Here's How Bridgerton Season 3 Differs From the Book</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christine-taylor-reveals-why-she-and-ben-stiller-rekindled-their-marriage-after-5-years-apart-812144.html>Christine Taylor Reveals Why She and Ben Stiller Rekindled Their Marriage After 5 Years Apart</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christine-taylor-reveals-why-she-and-ben-stiller-rekindled-their-marriage-after-5-years-apart-812144.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
