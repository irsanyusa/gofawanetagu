<time>17 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2017/07/DinaTitus.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>As she considers a U.S. Senate run, Democratic Rep. Dina Titus could find herself going up against the political machine built by former Senate Democratic&nbsp;Leader Harry Reid during his decades&nbsp;in Nevada politics.</p><p>Many strategists, elected officials and outside groups — from Nevada to Washington, D.C. — aligned almost instantly with Rep. Jacky Rosen, the first-term Democrat whom Reid and his leadership successor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), recruited&nbsp;to carry the party’s torch against Republican Sen. Dean Heller next fall.</p><p>“I’ve been dealing with that for a long time,” Titus said July 13&nbsp;when asked about Reid’s influence.&nbsp;During a brief&nbsp;interview on Capitol Hill just a week&nbsp;after Rosen’s campaign announcement, Titus said she was still thinking about&nbsp;a campaign.</p><p>Reid has opposed her in the past, first when she ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2006 and he quietly&nbsp;backed one of her opponents in the Democratic primary, which she won.&nbsp;This time, he has brought with him&nbsp;the backing of&nbsp;the Democrats in Nevada’s&nbsp;congressional delegation, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and EMILY’s List, all of whom endorsed Rosen.</p><p>Among Democratic officials and consultants, the Nevada Democratic Party is viewed as one of the premier state shops in the country, shepherded&nbsp;by top-tier operatives who in 2016 helped propel Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate, secure the state for Hillary Clinton and get Rosen — a computer programmer-turned-synagogue president&nbsp;— across the finish line in one of the nation’s hottest congressional races.</p><p>“It wasn’t always that way. I was state party chairman 20 years ago. It’s my dad — he raised a whole bunch of money and they really built it,” Rory Reid, &nbsp;the former senator’s eldest son, said in a phone interview Wednesday. In some tough Senate races, “it is why my dad could win when he probably shouldn’t have,” added Reid, a former Clark County commissioner and the 2010 Democratic Nevada gubernatorial nominee.</p><p>With Harry Reid’s&nbsp;backing&nbsp;comes the political apparatus that still exists in his retirement, which&nbsp;Rory Reid described as a “professional political operation” his father built&nbsp;mostly from scratch.</p><p>The former Nevada senator’s support&nbsp;includes deep fundraising ties and near-instant front-runner status in a Democratic primary.&nbsp;“There’s not many people who could overcome that,” Rory Reid&nbsp;said of potential challengers.</p><p>Titus has done so before. In 2011, after being ousted from her House seat after a single term, she launched a campaign&nbsp;against Reid’s pick in Nevada’s 1st District, then-state Sen. Ruben Kihuen, against Reid’s wishes. Less than three months later, Kihuen dropped his campaign for the party’s nomination, a development that prompted&nbsp;the&nbsp;Las Vegas Sun to declare, “<a href=#>Maybe Sen. Harry Reid is mortal after all</a>.”</p><p>With Clark County as her base, some&nbsp;Democratic consultants believe Titus — who served two decades in the state Senate before she was first elected to Congress in 2008 — could put up a fight in a primary, relying on roots among party faithful from years of campaigning, from union visits to dropping by other Democratic clubs and organizations.</p><p>“I got some pretty good poll numbers; I’m looking at those,” said Titus, a former political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p><p>An&nbsp;aide declined to share the numbers with Morning Consult.</p><p>Titus said she recognizes the appeal some see in Rosen’s status as a political newcomer, with not much of a voting record for Republicans&nbsp;to&nbsp;attack on the campaign trail. “That will be an easier race to run than someone who has a long record,” she said.</p><p>More than that, though, those close to Reid said they view a Senate run by Titus&nbsp;as nonviable due to fundraising challenges compared to putative rival Rosen. For one, according to her campaign’s latest filing with the Federal Election Commission,&nbsp;Titus has about <a href=#>$324,000</a> in the bank&nbsp;(she raised just under $170,000 so far this year). Rosen’s campaign raised $240,000 in the first three months of 2017 alone — before she even announced her candidacy — according to the&nbsp;<a href=#>most recent numbers</a> available from the FEC.</p><p>Titus’ detractors also point to her loss in 2006 when she ran for governor against Republican Jim&nbsp;Gibbons, a race many had viewed as a slam dunk after his campaign was rattled by a late-breaking scandal — and in a Democratic wave year, no less.</p><p>Democrats view Heller as uniquely vulnerable in a Senate map that has them on the defense in several states President Donald Trump won last fall.&nbsp;According to a&nbsp;<a href=#>50-state poll by Morning Consult</a>&nbsp;released last week, a third of Nevadans have a negative view of Heller. Forty-one percent said they view him favorably, while another 26 percent said they did not know or had no opinion.</p><p>Political operatives in Nevada and Washington pushed for a candidate to get in sooner rather than later in order to put pressure on Heller, who could also face a primary rival. Titus says there’s no rush.</p><p>“There’s a long time until the election,” she said. “We’ll see what’s going to happen with Heller and the health care vote, see if Heller gets a primary and see if Jacky [Rosen] catches on.”</p><p>Harry Reid declined an interview request for this story through an aide, who said he is not doing interviews about the Nevada Senate race.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxg45rZ2igkae%2FunnRnqCdq12hsqitwrJkoZmenMBuusSvmJ2ZXaiyr63TnmSrmZOafA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharry-reids-legacy-hangs-nevada-senate-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fharry-reids-legacy-hangs-nevada-senate-race.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fharry-reids-legacy-hangs-nevada-senate-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fharry-reids-legacy-hangs-nevada-senate-race.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharry-reids-legacy-hangs-nevada-senate-race.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharry-reids-legacy-hangs-nevada-senate-race.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-macy-gray-make-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-macy-gray-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Macy Gray Make?
