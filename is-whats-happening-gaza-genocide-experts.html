It’s been enough to prompt Craig Mokhiber, a director at the United Nations, to resign over the organization’s “failure” to act against what he called a "<a href=#>text-book case of genocide</a>." And in a Nov. 2 <a href=#>press release, a</a> separate coalition of U.N. experts similarly expressed concern, warning that Palestinians were “at grave risk of genocide.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Thursday, three Palestinian human rights organizations <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> with the International Criminal Court (ICC) to request arrest warrants against Israeli leaders—including Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu—for genocide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Scholars are torn on whether the current conflict can be yet classified a genocide officially. TIME spoke to several experts about the meaning of genocide and whether the current conflict could be labeled as such. Here’s what they said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What is genocide?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Genocide can be defined through three lenses: legal, social scientific, and conventional, according to Alexander Hinton, UNESCO Chair on genocide prevention at Rutgers University in New Jersey.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=#>U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” The acts include “killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group, and/or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most scholars TIME spoke to immediately referenced this definition, which was created in 1948. However, experts say the legal definition is tricky because the threshold to prove genocidal intent is extremely difficult. “One has to prove that the perpetrator not only committed the actions, but they committed the actions with a very specific intention of destroying the group,” says Ernesto Verdeja, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in genocide. “That can be a high bar because very often people contribute to genocidal policies, even if that's not their direct intention.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Scholars add, however, that many social scientists define genocide in a broader way. “[The current legal definition] identifies a very narrow set of categories of victims: ethnic, racial, national, religious, but it doesn't take into account people being targeted because of their socioeconomic status, or their political identity, or whatnot,” Verdeja says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hinton adds that the more colloquial definition for genocide focuses on the idea of “large scale destruction and acts perpetrated against a population.” Many may point to the Holocaust as the best example of this, though genocide, based on this broader definition, has happened many times over since, in places like <a href=#>Rwanda</a> and <a href=#>Guatemala</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Is what’s happening now a genocide?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Raz Segal, the program director of genocide studies at Stockton University, concretely says it is a “textbook case of genocide.” Segal believes that Israeli forces are completing three genocidal acts, including, “killing, causing serious bodily harm, and measures calculated to bring about the destruction of the group.” He points to the mass levels of destruction and total siege of basic necessities—like water, food, fuel, and medical supplies—as evidence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He says Israeli leaders expressed “explicit, clear, and direct statements of intent,” pointing to Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s <a href=#>statement</a> during an Oct. 13 press conference. In his statement, Herzog said, “It’s an entire nation that is out there that’s responsible. It’s not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. It’s absolutely not true,” Herzog said. “They could have risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup d'etat.” (Herzog later said that he is not holding the civilians of Gaza responsible for keeping Hamas in political power, when asked to clarify by a journalist at the same press conference.) Segal says that this language conflates all Palestinians as “an enemy population,” which could help prove intent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many experts TIME spoke to noted that they were answering based on whether they believed that the actions against Palestinians would be considered genocide under a court of law.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Verdeja says Israel's actions in Gaza are moving toward a “genocidal campaign.” While he notes that it is clear Israeli forces intend to destroy Hamas, “the response when you have a security crisis…can be one of ceasefire, negotiation, or it can be genocide.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">City University of New York professor Victoria Sanford compares what’s happening in Gaza to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">killing or disappearance</a> of more than 200,000 Mayans in Guatemala from 1960-1996, known as the Guatemalan genocide, which is the subject of her book Buried Secrets: Truth and Human Rights in Guatemala. Mayans and Palestinians have both been subject to genocidal acts, she implies. “When we match them to the lived experience of people, there are similar circumstances…if we look at contemporary conflicts like the Israeli invasion of Palestine.” Sanford and Segal were two of more than a 100 scholars and organizations that <a href=#>signed a letter</a> urging the ICC to take action given the “Israeli intention to commit genocide visibly materialising on the ground."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sanford is also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of three scholars</a> who signed a declaration in support of a lawsuit announced on Nov. 13 filed by the nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights. A group of Palestinians living in Gaza and the U.S. as well as human rights organizations, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are suing</a> President Joe Biden and other state officials because they allege the U.S. is not taking “all measures available to it to prevent a genocide.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">David Simon, director of the genocide studies program at Yale University, says that Israel has only explicitly said they want to exterminate Hamas, and has not directly stated intent to “destroy a religious, ethnic or racial group.” Simon says it's possible a court could conclude that either Hamas or some elements of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) could be found guilty of committing an act of genocide, but “it's certainly not textbook in that connecting the intent to destroy ethnic group as such is difficult.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ben Kiernan, the director of the Cambodian Genocide Program at Yale University, also agrees. In an emailed statement to TIME, he wrote that “Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza, however indiscriminate, and its current ground attacks, despite the numerous civilian casualties they are causing among Gaza's Palestinian population, do not meet the very high threshold that is required to meet the legal definition of genocide.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hinton also noted that when Mokhiber called it a “textbook case of genocide,” he seemed to be “drawing on a more social scientific understanding that looks at settler colonialism and sort of this long term gradual erasure of a group.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All scholars who spoke to TIME say that it is much more likely that both Hamas and some Israeli officials could be found guilty of crimes against humanity. Kiernan notes that the groups were more likely to be found guilty of extermination, which “does not require proof of a perpetrator's conscious desire to destroy a group ‘as such.’”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Significance of the use of the word genocide</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some scholars, like Verdeja, say that debates on whether the current conflict can be called a genocide are a “bad use of focus.” Part of that is because proving whether something is a genocide takes time, and does not actually stop people from being killed. Hinton agrees, noting that because genocide is seen as the crime of all crimes, people focus too rigidly on defining a particular moment as such.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other scholars note that referring to a specific moment as a genocide is extremely significant. Segal points to how the U.S. government refused to call crimes committed against the Tutsis in Rwanda a genocide because doing so meant they would have to send personnel to intervene. The lack of action by the U.S. allowed the massacre to continue to unfold, he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Without sticking to the truth, we'll never have a truthful reckoning of how we arrived at the seventh of October, and how we go forward,” Segal says. “We need to name it for what it is.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The original version of this story misstated the name of the ethnic group that faced targeting in Rwanda. It was the Tutsis, not the Hutus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2NpgXGFjqKqZq%2BYlsG0eceap6mdnp67qHnGmrGaZZeau7CvyJ2cZp2opbKzwNJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-whats-happening-gaza-genocide-experts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ian-brennan-graduation-speech-loyola-chicago.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ian-brennan-graduation-speech-loyola-chicago.html>Loyola University Chicago: Ian Brennan Graduation Speech 2015</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-bobby-brown-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bobby Brown Make?
