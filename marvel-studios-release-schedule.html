(The animated series “Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man” is expected to debut by the end of 2024.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Moving forward, Marvel will release <a href=#>no more than three feature films and two live-action series</a> a year. For 2025, that will include a sequel to “Captain America” with Anthony Mackie and Harrison Ford and director Julius Onah; the anti-hero team up movie “Thunderbolts” with Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan and director Jake Schreier; and “The Fantastic Four” with Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby and director Matt Shakman. On Disney+, Matt Murdock will be “Daredevil: Born Again,” with Charlie Cox and Vincent D’Onofrio, and the “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” spin-off series “Ironheart” will finally arrive with Dominique Thorne and Anthony Ramos.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Further on the horizon: “Wonder Man” with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; a second “WandaVision” spin-off featuring Paul Bettany’s Vision (or his ghostly doppelgänger); and the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU —&nbsp;as Victor von Doom.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Here is everything that’s in store — that we know about.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>"Agatha All Along" (Sept. 18)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Agatha-All-Along.png><p><strong>On Disney+</strong></p><p>As Variety first <a href=#>reported</a>, Kathryn Hahn will star in this “WandaVision” spin-off series about Agatha Harkness, the witch she played to Emmy-nominated perfection. “WandaVision” head writer Jac Schaeffer will write and executive produce the show, part of her overall deal with Marvel Studios and 20th Television. In keeping with Hahn’s performance, the new show will be a dark comedy — and a mischievous one.</p><p>The show was first announced with the title “Agatha: House of Harkness”; in July 2022, that was updated to “Agatha: Coven of Chaos,” then in Sept. 2023, updated again to “Agatha: Darkhold Diaries,” and finally in May 2024 to “Agatha: The Lying Witch With Great Wardrobe.” The real title was finally revealed at Disney’s 2024 upfront presentation as “Agatha All Along,” evoking the instant classic song about the witch from “WandaVision.”</p><p>Patti LuPone, Aubrey Plaza, Joe Locke (“Heartstopper”), Sasheer Zamata (“Saturday Night Live”), Ali Ahn (“The Diplomat”) and Miles Gutierrez-Riley (“The Wilds”) will costar, with Debra Jo Rupp and Emma Caulfield Ford reprising their roles from “WandaVision.”</p><p><strong>MCU Tie-In: </strong>Unclear, but Agatha’s connection to Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) certainly seems to provide ample storytelling possibilities, especially since, when we last saw Agatha, she’d been trapped by Wanda in her sitcom persona of Agnes, the quintessential sitcom nosy neighbor. A second “WandaVision” spin-off focusing on Paul Bettany’s Vision is also in development (more on that series below).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>"Your Friendly Neighborhood&nbsp;Spider-Man" (2024)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-12-at-9.26.07-AM.png><p><strong>On Disney+</strong></p><p>Unlike the smooth, modern look of “What If…?”, this animated show will harken back to Peter Parker’s comic book origins as he begins his journey to become Spider-Man.</p><p>This version of Peter’s life will feature a bunch of new characters, including Nico Minoru, from the Runaways team; a new crush who isn’t Mary Jane or Gwen Stacey; Amadeus Cho, who becomes a new Hulk in the comics; a Wakandan exchange student; and Harry Osborn, with Harry’s father Norman (voiced by Colman Domingo) serving as Peter’s mentor.

Shira Haas (“Unorthodox”) joins the cast as Ruth Bat-Seraph, a.k.a. Sabra. In the comics, Sabra is a mutant who works as an agent of the Israeli Mossad, but a spokesperson for Marvel <a href=#>tells Variety</a> that the filmmakers are taking “a new approach” with the character.</p><p>Julius Onah (“Luce,” “The Cloverfield Paradox”) is directing from a screenplay by “FAWS” head writer Malcolm Spellman and staff writer Dalan Musson, with Matthew Orton (“Moon Knight”) writing material for additional photography in 2024.</p><p>The film was originally subtitled “New World Order,” but Disney announced it was changed to “Brave New World” in June 2023. While main photography concluded before the SAG-AFTRA strike, Disney pushed the film from a May 2024 release to Feb. 2025.</p><p><strong>MCU Tie-In: </strong>Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, will appear as the president of the United States in “Brave New World” — <a href=#>played by Harrison</a><a href=#> Ford</a>, replacing the late actor William Hurt, who originated the role in 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk” and played it several times, most recently in 2021’s “Black Widow.” As the first trailer all but confirmed, Ross will also transform into the Red Hulk.</p><p>Another character who began in “The Incredible Hulk” is also returning: Tim Blake Nelson will play Samuel Sterns, a.k.a. The Leader. In that film, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) forces Samuel to use blood samples from Bruce Banner (played by Edward Norton) to transform Emil into the Abomination. In the aftermath, some of Bruce’s blood lands on an open wound on Emil’s skull, transforming him into The Leader. Seventeen years later, we’ll finally see what happened next for Samuel.</p><p>This film will also finally deal with the ending of 2021’s “Eternals,” when a colossal Celestial emerged in the Indian Ocean and was turned to stone. As revealed at 2024’s San Diego Comic-Con, the metal adamantium will be discovered within the Celestial’s body — an eyebrow-raising addition to the MCU.</p><p>The Leader and Ross may not be the only MCU legacy characters to return for “Brave New World,” especially since the anti-hero team-up movie “Thunderbolts” is set to follow later in 2025, which features disgraced former Captain America John Walker (Wyatt Russell), a.k.a. U.S. Agent, and the shadowy operative Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) — two characters first introduced on “FAWS.” And then there’s the post-credits tease for “FAWS,” in which Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) revealed herself to be the nefarious Power Broker just as she’s pardoned and brought back into the U.S. government — what’s to become of her?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>"Daredevil: Born Again" (March 2025)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/172964_JA1_1025.jpg><p><strong>On Disney+</strong></p><p>After “Daredevil” ran for three seasons on Netflix through 2018, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) faded back into the shadows once the streamer cut ties with Marvel in advance of the debut of Disney+. After Murdock popped up as Peter Parker’s lawyer in 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” — and his nemesis, Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio), reemerged the same month as the lead villain on “Hawkeye” — there was a great deal of anticipation that the Man Without Fear would return to fight crime again.</p><p>In May 2022, Variety reported that Matt Corman and Chris Ord (“Covert Affairs”) signed up to write and executive produce a new “Daredevil” series, which Feige announced will unfold over 18 episodes — triple the usual number for a drama series in the MCU.</p><p>Since then, the show underwent <a href=#>a significant creative overhaul</a>: Corman and Ord exited the series midway through production, and Dario Scardapane (“The Punisher”) stepped in as the new showrunner. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead (“Loki,” “Hawkeye”) will direct the bulk of the episodes of Season 1, which will most likely not consist of all 18 episodes.</p><p><strong>MCU Tie-In: </strong>Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and especially Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox) have a complicated relationship with Kingpin, so either of those characters could factor on the show. Matt’s burgeoning relationship with Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany), a.k.a. the title hero of “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” could also wind up on the show (though that seems like much more of a stretch).</p><p>The big question, however, has been if the events of Netflix’s “Daredevil” are part of the MCU and would be incorporated into “Daredevil: Born Again.” For years, Marvel Studios was publicly coy, and privately dismissive, about whether it would be integrating the Netflix shows into its storytelling. But in Jan. 2024, Marvel executive Brad Winderbaum <a href=# data-wplink-edit=true rel=nofollow>told Screen Rant</a> that he was “confident” that the Netflix series&nbsp;was part of “the sacred timeline” — i.e., the main MCU — which means&nbsp;Jon Bernthal’s Frank Castle (aka the Punisher) will be bringing all of his Netflix baggage with him when he appears on “Born Again.” Whether any of the other Netflix Marvel characters — including Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Mike Colter (Luke Cage) or Danny Rand aka Iron Fist (Finn Jones) — will also return remains to be seen.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>"Thunderbolts*" (May 2, 2025)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Walt-Disney-D23.jpg><p><strong>In Theaters</strong></p><p>Marvel Studios’ answer to DC’s Suicide Squad, the Thunderbolts are a team of anti-heroes — or reformed villains, depending on your point of view — who are formed at first to do bad but then decide to try to make up for the errors of their ways.</p><p>Jake Schreier (“Paper Towns”) will direct from a script by Eric Pearson (“Black Widow”). The team will include Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier) from “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” and “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”; Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova from “Black Widow” and “Hawkeye”; David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov (aka Red Guardian) from “Black Widow”; Wyatt Russell as John Walker (aka U.S. Agent) from “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”; Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr (aka Ghost) from “Ant-Man and the Wasp”; Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster from “Black Widow”; and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine from “Falcon and Winter Soldier,” “Black Widow” and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”</p><p>“Thunderbolts*” was originally set to open in late 2024, until the SAG-AFTRA strike delayed production and pushed its release to 2025.</p><p>At CinemaCon in 2024, Kevin Feige revealed that the title to the film includes an asterisk, and then teased that Marvel “won’t talk more about that until after the movie comes out.”</p><p><strong>MCU Tie-In:&nbsp;</strong>All of these characters carry a lot of baggage with them from their earlier appearances, which will no doubt factor into whatever transpires in “Thunderbolts*.” With “Captain America: New World Order” opening a few months earlier, one also expects Sam Wilson, aka Captain America (Anthony Mackie), could play some kind of role here. And given that Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is a major character in the Thunderbolts in the comics, he could pop up as well.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>“The Fantastic 4: First Steps” (July 25, 2025)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TheFantastic4_IMG_6520.jpg><p><strong>In Theaters</strong></p><p>When Disney bought 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), Marvel fans knew it would mean that the X-Men and the Fantastic Four — the two classic Marvel franchises that had heretofore existed outside the MCU — would finally join the fold.</p><p>Matt Shakman (“WandaVision”) will direct the film.

Afterwards, many variants of Marvel characters find themselves living on a post-apocalyptic planet called Battleworld.</p><p>How the MCU will get to this point (if this is indeed the plot of the movie) remains something of a mystery, although several major players in the comic book storyline — including the Fantastic Four (Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and their mortal enemy Victor von Doom (Robert Downey Jr.) — are now set to make their debuts in the MCU in the run up to this film and its predecessor, “Avengers: Doomsday.” Joe and Anthony Russo will direct both films, and Stephen McFeely will handle the the screenplay.</p><p>Something else to consider: Following “Secret Wars,” Marvel Comics more-or-less rebooted, launching “all-new, all-different” versions of many of its most beloved titles.

Marvel, smartly, said yes.</p><p>Since then, however, two directors — Bassam Tariq (“Mogul Mowgli”) and Yann Demange (“Lovecraft Country”) — have departed the film and at least six screenwriters have been tapped to write the screenplay.
