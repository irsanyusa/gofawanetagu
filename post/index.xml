Back in 2015, he roasted himself, though, in a sketch on James Corden’s Late Late Show.

Travers was notoriously wary of signing over the rights to her famous children’s character, Mary Poppins, to Walt Disney. In fact, an entire movie—2013’s Saving Mr. Banks—was made about Disney’s overtures to the author. But eventually, as we now know, Travers caved.

But the rewrite proved popular: Mary Poppins became one of the most successful and beloved musicals in cinematic history.</description></item><item><title>100+ funny bios for Instagram to get a chuckle out of your followers</title><link>/1534692-funny-bios-instagram-a-chuckle-followers.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/1534692-funny-bios-instagram-a-chuckle-followers.html</guid><description>Are you looking to spice up your Instagram profile with funny bio ideas?

The wanted man was one of the most loathsome creatures of modern times: “Ivan the Terrible,” who hacked at his naked victims with a sword as he herded them by the thousands into the gas chambers he operated at the Nazi death camp Treblinka. American and Israeli officials were certain they had found him in John, formerly Ivan, Demjanjuk, a retired suburban Cleveland autoworker of Ukrainian descent.</description></item><item><title>l'tat et les rgions actent le remplacement de la CVAE par de la TVA</title><link>/relance-letat-et-les-regions-actent-le-remplacement-de-la-cvae-par-de-la-tva.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/relance-letat-et-les-regions-actent-le-remplacement-de-la-cvae-par-de-la-tva.html</guid><description>Publié le&amp;nbsp;30 juillet 2020par&amp;nbsp; Michel Tendil / Localtis Finances et fiscalité, Développement économique, Cohésion des territoires L’accord avait été annoncé pour le mois de juillet.

Meanwhile, the data showed women orgasm more when they masturbate. Two facts can be obtained from this data: first, penetration benefits mostly men, and second, it’s not the sole way to pleasure. Penetration itself can pose an issue with timing if one partner orgasms before the other, and then one leaves feelings dissatisfied.</description></item><item><title>The History of the Patriots Scandal in Text Messages</title><link>/deflategate-text-messages-patriots-tom-brady.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/deflategate-text-messages-patriots-tom-brady.html</guid><description>A report released by the NFL on Wednesday found that the New England Patriots had likely deflated game balls for the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts on Jan. 18. Investigators not only zeroed in on two employees suspected of purposefully deflating footballs below regulation levels—John Jastremski, a team equipment assistant, and locker room attendant Jim McNally—but that star quarterback Tom Brady was probably “at least generally aware.”
The 243-page report draws from an array of sources, including interviews and surveillance camera footage, but the text messages exchanged between Jastremski and McNally provide a colorful (and at times expletive-filled) lens into what has become known as Deflategate.</description></item><item><title>Voting Intention: Con 21%, Lab 54% (28-29 Sep 2022)</title><link>/43901-voting-intention-con-21-lab-54-28-29-sep-2022.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/43901-voting-intention-con-21-lab-54-28-29-sep-2022.html</guid><description>Labour open up 33-point vote intention lead in wake of mini-Budget chaosThe latest YouGov/Times vote intention poll shows the Labour party on 54% of the vote, up nine points on their previous record high with YouGov on Monday.

Even though we&amp;nbsp;don’t do&amp;nbsp;them consciously, some gestures can honestly describe how we&amp;nbsp;feel inside and say a&amp;nbsp;lot about&amp;nbsp;us. Understanding body language can be&amp;nbsp;helpful in&amp;nbsp;various situations, so&amp;nbsp;it’s important to&amp;nbsp;know what these things mean.

Bond is dead. Long live James Bond.
In the franchise’s storied 58-year history, 007 has never actually died. Bond movies usually end with the successful destruction of a villain’s lair, and the camera panning away as the hero beds a Bond girl—on a boat, in space, on a balcony, often with his would-be rescuers looking on. The next movie may star the same actor or a different one, but rarely does anything of real consequence—romances, villainous encounters—carry over from film to film.</description></item><item><title>Point dactualit sur les enjeux intercommunaux de cette fin danne (compte-rendu)</title><link>/point-dactualite-sur-les-enjeux-intercommunaux-de-cette-fin-dannee-compte-rendu.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/point-dactualite-sur-les-enjeux-intercommunaux-de-cette-fin-dannee-compte-rendu.html</guid><description>L’actualité intercommunale va être dense dans les prochaines semaines.

Abobaku lives and enjoys the same luxurious life as the king; whatever the king eats or drinks, he has the same.

Game of Thrones is a rare example of mass entertainment that took the time to build compelling character arcs over the course of several seasons. The redemption of Jaime or the Hound were slow, carefully plotted evolutions — until they weren’t.
So Daenerys’ turn from hero to villain should have been a triumph of plot development. If the showrunners wanted to argue that power corrupts everyone, carefully tracing Daenerys’ descent from Breaker of Chains to Mad Queen killed by her lover could have been a smart, honest, compelling storytelling choice.</description></item><item><title>Keira Knightley Reveals the Reason Why She Wont Return to Pirates of the Caribbean</title><link>/keira-knightley-reveals-the-reason-why-she-wont-return-to-pirates-of-the-caribbean-813640.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/keira-knightley-reveals-the-reason-why-she-wont-return-to-pirates-of-the-caribbean-813640.html</guid><description>In&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;recent revelation, Keira Knightley shared that she had to&amp;nbsp;undergo “many years of&amp;nbsp;therapy ” after her appearance in&amp;nbsp;Pirates Of&amp;nbsp;The Caribbean, as&amp;nbsp;the experience was “traumatic” for her.
