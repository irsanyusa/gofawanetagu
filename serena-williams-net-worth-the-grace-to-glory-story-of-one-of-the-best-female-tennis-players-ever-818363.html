In&nbsp;this article, we&nbsp;delve into the captivating journey of&nbsp;Serena Williams, from her humble beginnings to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;global icon and an&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;millions.</p><p><h2>Early life and career beginnings</h2></p><p>One of&nbsp;the most dominant and iconic figures in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;women’s tennis, Serena Williams was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;September&nbsp;26, 1981, in&nbsp;Saginaw, Michigan. Serena Williams net worth may now count in&nbsp;the millions, but it&nbsp;wasn’t always that way. She was born into the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> of&nbsp;Oracene Price and Richard Williams, and was one of&nbsp;seven children.</p><p>Raised in&nbsp;Compton, California, along with her older sister Venus, Serena showed an&nbsp;early aptitude for the sport. Their father, Richard Williams, who had no&nbsp;prior tennis experience, taught himself the game from instructional videos and coached his daughters with a&nbsp;rigorous training regimen.</p><p>From a&nbsp;young age, Serena displayed remarkable talent and determination on&nbsp;the tennis court. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;four</a>, she began practicing regularly on&nbsp;the public courts of&nbsp;Compton, often facing challenges such as&nbsp;violence in&nbsp;the neighborhood. Despite these obstacles, Serena’s passion for the sport only grew stronger. Eventually, the Williams sisters relocated to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Florida data-link=tag>Florida</a> to&nbsp;train under <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rick Macci</a>’s guidance at&nbsp;his academy.</p><p>The bond between Serena and Venus is&nbsp;truly special. Venus, the elder sister and a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>7-time Grand Slam champion</a>, paved the way for her sister in&nbsp;the sport. Serena <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledges</a> Venus’s influence, crediting her as&nbsp;the reason for her success, «There would be&nbsp;no&nbsp;Serena if&nbsp;there wasn’t a&nbsp;Venus. Venus is&nbsp;so&nbsp;humble she doesn’t really take credit for that, but she burst open that door and&nbsp;I ran through. She was my&nbsp;hero, and she’s still my&nbsp;hero.»</p><p>Together, they amassed an&nbsp;impressive collection of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>14&nbsp;major doubles titles</a>, strengthening their sisterly bond on&nbsp;and off the court.</p><p>Their unwavering support for one another is&nbsp;evident both on&nbsp;and off the court. Despite <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>competing</a> against each other 31&nbsp;times in&nbsp;professional tournaments, with Serena <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leading</a> their head-to-head 19–12, their sisterly bond remains unbreakable.</p><p><h2>Rising to&nbsp;prominence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b30/79a/15800359ab9e512c1ab60d0989.jpg><p>Serena’s talent and determination quickly became evident as&nbsp;she rose through the ranks of&nbsp;junior tennis, captivating audiences with her powerful serve and relentless style of&nbsp;play. Her professional tennis <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>journey</a> in&nbsp;1995.</p><p>However, the breakthrough moment came only in&nbsp;1999 when she won her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first Grand Slam singles title</a> at&nbsp;the US&nbsp;Open, announcing her arrival on&nbsp;the international stage. Alongside her sister Venus, they clinched their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first doubles Grand Slam title</a> in&nbsp;1999 and claimed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Olympic Gold</a> in&nbsp;doubles at&nbsp;the Sydney Olympics in&nbsp;2000.</p><p><h2>Challenges and setbacks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6b/f57/8295eb594b818b4512c1d69826.jpg><p>Despite early success, Serena faced challenges. In&nbsp;2002, an&nbsp;ankle <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>injury</strong></a><strong> didn’t stop her from achieving the </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Serena Slam</strong></a>, conquering four consecutive Grand Slam tournaments.</p><p>In&nbsp;2003, the reigning US&nbsp;Open champion <strong>faced significant </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>challenges</strong></a>. She couldn’t defend her title at&nbsp;Flushing Meadows due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;injury. The injury required surgery to&nbsp;repair a&nbsp;partial tear in&nbsp;the quadriceps tendon of&nbsp;her left knee. This setback interrupted Serena’s dominant streak, during which she had won 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;the previous 6&nbsp;Grand Slam tournaments between 2002 and 2003.</p><p>In&nbsp;2006, Serena <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>revealed</strong></a><strong> struggles with injury and <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> </strong>after a&nbsp;setback at&nbsp;the Australian Open. Taking a&nbsp;break from the tour, she fell to&nbsp;no.95 in&nbsp;rankings but returned triumphantly in&nbsp;2007, seizing the Australian Open title. <strong>In&nbsp;2011, both sisters experienced health problems. </strong>Venus was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a> with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sjögren syndrome</a>, an&nbsp;autoimmune disorder. And Serena was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a> with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pulmonary embolism</a>. Through these trials, they leaned on&nbsp;each other, with Serena affectionately <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calling</a> Venus her «rock.»</p><p><strong>Serena’s final </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>appearance</strong></a> was at&nbsp;the 2022&nbsp;US Open. Guided by&nbsp;her new coach, she reached the third round before bidding farewell to&nbsp;her home tournament. While her quest for another title may have ended, Serena’s impact on&nbsp;the sport and her enduring legacy as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;tennis’s greatest players will continue to&nbsp;inspire generations to&nbsp;come.</p><p><h2>Off-court ventures</h2></p><p><h2><strong>Nike deal</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58a/4d3/0d367151b2b2490f20b9c43ae9.jpg><p>Advertising contacts make a&nbsp;big contribution to&nbsp;Serena Williams net worth. In&nbsp;2003, Serena Williams made history by&nbsp;signing a&nbsp;groundbreaking <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$55 million deal with Nike</strong></a>. This partnership has lasted for many years and has led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;special <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tribute</a> from Nike in&nbsp;2022. The sportswear giant honored Williams by&nbsp;unveiling a&nbsp;building at&nbsp;its headquarters in&nbsp;Oregon named after her.</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41, Williams shared her excitement about the building, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «The whole building takes your breath away. Every element, everywhere you&nbsp;go, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;be&nbsp;inspired. I&nbsp;hope this building encourages people to&nbsp;bring out the best of&nbsp;themselves and to&nbsp;dream bigger than they thought possible.»</p><p><h2><strong>DirecTV deal</strong></h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2021, Serena Williams <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>starred</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big advertisement for DirecTV’s streaming service, but the exact amount she earned for it&nbsp;isn’t known. The ad&nbsp;had a&nbsp;Matrix-style theme, and Serena was dressed as&nbsp;Wonder Woman. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;major part of&nbsp;DirecTV’s advertising campaign.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Vince Torres, DirecTV’s chief marketing officer, this campaign was the company’s most costly since 2015 when it&nbsp;spent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$164.6 million on&nbsp;advertising</strong></a>.</p><p><h2><strong>Real estate ventures</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e1/ddb/6fa42e5977858f62c27f6a89e7.jpg><p>Evan Agostini/Invision/East News</p><p>Serena made a&nbsp;smart move, buying <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>a&nbsp;mansion in&nbsp;Beverly Hills</strong></a> in&nbsp;2017. Her new home, a&nbsp;Spanish-inspired residence in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private gated community, cost her<strong> $6.2&nbsp;million</strong>. The mansion is&nbsp;around 6,000 square feet and has five bedrooms and six and a&nbsp;half bathrooms. Serena’s new neighbors include other celebrities like <a href=# title="Britney Spears" data-link=tag>Britney Spears</a>, <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a>, Ed&nbsp;McMahon, and Gwen Stefani.</p><p>Inside, the living room features a&nbsp;lovely fireplace, while the spacious kitchen has a&nbsp;double-wide island. Downstairs, there’s an&nbsp;entertaining area with a&nbsp;wet bar and a&nbsp;walk-in wine cellar. Outside, Serena can enjoy a&nbsp;fantastic outdoor cooking space and a&nbsp;swimming pool to&nbsp;stay fit and have fun. It’s no&nbsp;wonder she chose such a&nbsp;luxurious and convenient spot to&nbsp;call home.</p><p>Serena, known to&nbsp;speak French fluently, also has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>an&nbsp;apartment in&nbsp;Paris</strong></a> with a&nbsp;beautiful view of&nbsp;the Eiffel Tower. Though it’s just a&nbsp;two-bedroom space, Serena, her partner Alexis, and their daughter Alexis&nbsp;Jr. find it&nbsp;spacious and luxurious enough. In&nbsp;2016, Serena generously gave her fans a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;her Parisian apartment on&nbsp;Snapchat. «So&nbsp;here’s a&nbsp;tour of&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a> apartment,» she began, showcasing her living room adorned with her numerous trophies.</p><p>She then displayed her impressive wardrobe, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joking</a> with her followers, «I&nbsp;can pretend I’m the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.» Despite some Americans’ reluctance towards Europe, Serena feels quite at&nbsp;home in&nbsp;France. As&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> with USA Today in&nbsp;2013, «A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;Americans don’t like Europe, and&nbsp;I can understand. But I&nbsp;like a&nbsp;change.»</p><p>Back in&nbsp;2015, Serena purchased <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>a&nbsp;house in&nbsp;Palm Beach Gardens</strong></a>, South Florida, for <strong>$2.4&nbsp;million. </strong>Situated on&nbsp;1.25 acres of&nbsp;land, the newly built house boasts five bedrooms and five bathrooms. When her daughter Alexis was born, Serena chose to&nbsp;quietly retreat to&nbsp;Florida to&nbsp;raise him, occasionally sharing photos of&nbsp;him on&nbsp;Instagram. The lush green gardens surrounding the property provide a&nbsp;serene environment for raising a&nbsp;child. The luxury home also includes a&nbsp;stunning pool and a&nbsp;spa, ideal for relaxing after a&nbsp;tough day on&nbsp;the tennis court.</p><p>During their active tennis <a href=# title=careers data-link=tag>careers</a>, Serena and her sister Venus lived together in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>a&nbsp;mansion in&nbsp;Palm Beach Gardens</strong></a>, which they bought for over <strong>$600,000</strong> in&nbsp;1998. They decided to&nbsp;sell this property 20&nbsp;years later for <strong>$2.5&nbsp;million</strong>. In&nbsp;2019, Serena sold her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Bel-Air home</strong></a>, which she bought in&nbsp;2006 for <strong>$6.62&nbsp;million</strong>. Initially, she listed it&nbsp;for sale at&nbsp;$12 million in&nbsp;October 2017. After two price cuts, it&nbsp;eventually sold for <strong>$8.1 million</strong> two years later.</p><p><h2>Personal life and family</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42b/909/4d856b50f683833547a18fbccb.jpg><p>Serena Williams’ husband is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alexis Kerry Ohanian</a>.

They got married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> inspired by ’Beauty and the Beast’ in&nbsp;New Orleans, Louisiana. The wedding cost a&nbsp;lot, with Serena’s<strong> dress alone </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>costing</strong></a><strong> $3.5&nbsp;million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8e/365/e4bfb95a328833ca26ef2c09a0.jpg><p>Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian have two <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughters</a>. Their first daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian&nbsp;Jr., known as&nbsp;Olympia, was born on&nbsp;September&nbsp;1, 2017. Later, in&nbsp;August 2023, they welcomed their second daughter, Adira River Ohanian.</p><p>After Olympia was born, Serena talked about being a&nbsp;mom and a&nbsp;tennis player. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «The only rule&nbsp;I have at&nbsp;practice is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done at&nbsp;1&nbsp;p.m., because as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I love tennis, I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with her. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;put her above everything else I’m doing. Since she was born, I&nbsp;haven’t been apart from her for more than a&nbsp;day.» She also mentioned the possibility of&nbsp;having another baby, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «If&nbsp;I&nbsp;weren’t working, I’d already be&nbsp;pregnant. I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;play if&nbsp;I have another baby.»</p><p>Serena also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> her opinion on&nbsp;how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;for female athletes to&nbsp;combine motherhood and career, «I&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;choose between tennis and a&nbsp;family. I&nbsp;don’t think it’s fair. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;were a&nbsp;guy, I&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;writing this because I’d be&nbsp;out there playing and winning while my&nbsp;wife was doing the physical labor of&nbsp;expanding our family. Maybe I’d be&nbsp;more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Tom Brady if&nbsp;I had that opportunity.<br>Don’t get me&nbsp;wrong: I&nbsp;love being a&nbsp;woman, and&nbsp;I loved every second of&nbsp;being pregnant with Olympia. I&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;report to&nbsp;the hospital&nbsp;— although things got super complicated on&nbsp;the other side. And I&nbsp;almost did do&nbsp;the impossible: A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people don’t realize that&nbsp;I was two months pregnant when&nbsp;I won the Australian Open in&nbsp;2017. But I’m turning 41&nbsp;this month, and something’s got to&nbsp;give.»</p><p>Williams took a&nbsp;break from tennis in&nbsp;September 2022, almost a&nbsp;year before her second child was born. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=podcast data-link=tag>podcast</a> a&nbsp;few months later, she shared how her older daughter, Olympia, felt about having more time with her. «She wants to&nbsp;make sure that I’m aware that&nbsp;I should have time on&nbsp;my&nbsp;hands and&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;spend more time with her,» Williams <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. «It’s funny, but it’s good because little kids really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with their parents. And I&nbsp;just feel fortunate that she wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with&nbsp;me. That’s kind of&nbsp;how&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;it, because she could feel a&nbsp;different way, and I’m glad she doesn’t.»</p><p>Williams has talked before about the challenges of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;mom, but she also finds happiness in&nbsp;the change. «I’ve been so&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;my&nbsp;career my&nbsp;whole life, but when&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;family and got married, I&nbsp;realized that there’s so&nbsp;much more to&nbsp;life.
