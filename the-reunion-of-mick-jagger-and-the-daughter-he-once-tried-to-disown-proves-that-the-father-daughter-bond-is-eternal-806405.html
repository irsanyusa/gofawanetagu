His numerous romantic relationships and two <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriages</a> resulted in&nbsp;him being the father of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>eight children</a>, ranging from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>5</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>51</a>-years-old. Although it&nbsp;seems like he’s enjoying being a&nbsp;father and grandfather now, that was not always the case. Jagger has long been estranged from his oldest daughter, but an&nbsp;unexpected turn of&nbsp;events brought them close together, straightening their bond like never before.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you the story about the rocky relationship between Jagger and his daughter Karis that proves how powerful a&nbsp;father-daughter bond can&nbsp;be.</p><p><h2>78-year old Jagger is&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;8&nbsp;kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8eb/480/20af4459408c1eb4f3c7cfebc3.jpg><p>When the now 78-year-old rocker was in&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>20s</a>, he&nbsp;dated American model, singer, and <a href=# title=actress data-link=tag>actress</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marsha Hunt</a>. The pair met during a&nbsp;photo shoot in&nbsp;1970, and soon after, their <strong>passionate but short</strong> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>affair</a> began. Hunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that Jagger’s “shyness and awkwardness” swept her off her feet. Their romance was kept mostly private due to&nbsp;differences in&nbsp;their social lives.</p><p>Hunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that even though they <strong>planned on&nbsp;having a&nbsp;<a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a></strong>, they didn’t intend to&nbsp;stay together. Jagger thought about proposing to&nbsp;her, but didn’t think he&nbsp;loved her enough to&nbsp;spend the rest of&nbsp;his life with her. Hunt felt the same about Jagger.</p><p><h2>Their romance was short but passionate.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae7/287/1d79bf56d0b378151888cb7180.jpg><p>The romance ended in&nbsp;June 1970 while Marsha was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnant</a>. Their daughter Karis was born on&nbsp;November 4&nbsp;in&nbsp;London. She was the first of&nbsp;Jagger’s <strong>8&nbsp;children</strong> and the only child of&nbsp;her mother, Marsha.</p><p>The couple soon parted ways, with Jagger becoming increasingly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>distant</a> from his former partner. He&nbsp;even refused to&nbsp;legally acknowledge that he&nbsp;was Karis’ father, forcing Marsha to&nbsp;battle in&nbsp;court for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child support</a>.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was not in&nbsp;love with her but said she was very talented.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/457/6bc/2353a0541896ee49112e8c1c5f.jpg><p>He&nbsp;didn’t wait long to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;with dating other women. His then-girlfriend Catherine James <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a>: “When I&nbsp;moved into Mick’s house, I&nbsp;knew about Marsha, but his relationship with her was already over. <strong>It&nbsp;didn’t seem a&nbsp;big deal to&nbsp;him</strong>. He&nbsp;just mentioned that she was a&nbsp;girl he&nbsp;had met who had got pregnant. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;wasn’t in&nbsp;love with her, but she was very talented.”</p><p>Marsha was alone during the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delivery</a> of&nbsp;their daughter, and Jagger only visited her and the baby once a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days later. For the next several years, Marsha struggled to&nbsp;make her ex-partner pay <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child support</a> and medical bills. Finally, in&nbsp;1977 she moved to&nbsp;the United States and after almost 2&nbsp;years, she was able to&nbsp;<strong>hire top lawyers</strong> to&nbsp;help her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a01/4f2/bbc2d55672a8b108ba697fcb3f.jpg><p>However, Jagger’s lawyers made Marsha sign papers stating <strong>he&nbsp;was not the father</strong>, to&nbsp;which she unwillingly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agreed</a>. “I&nbsp;don’t know why Mick did that because he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;at&nbsp;the time that Karis was his child,” Jagger’s then-girlfriend, Catherine James <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. Finally, in&nbsp;1979, a&nbsp;court in&nbsp;Los Angeles ruled Jagger was indeed the father of&nbsp;the child, and he&nbsp;was forced to&nbsp;pay monthly child support.</p><p>But despite his rejection, Marsha wanted Karis to&nbsp;know who her father&nbsp;is. When <i>The</i> <i>Rolling Stones’</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>songs</a> came on&nbsp;the radio, she would tell her, <strong>“that’s your daddy.”</strong> When asked if&nbsp;she feels bad for raising a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;such an&nbsp;unfavorable situation, Marsha says: “No. What happened was not my&nbsp;fault. Besides, whatever happened with Mick, she went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;have such a&nbsp;<strong>fabulous life</strong>.”</p><p><h2>Jagger claimed their daughter Karis was not his child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c2/0a9/90c4495635b612683e1421875b.jpg><p>Then out of&nbsp;the blue, when Karis was 12,<strong> Mick decided it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know her better. </strong>But it&nbsp;was not an&nbsp;easy step for him either:<strong> </strong>“<strong>He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;step down from a&nbsp;pedestal</strong> and say ’Yes, I’m her dad, come home with me,’ when he&nbsp;had publicly said something else,” Marsha <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>.</p><p>This seemingly sudden change of&nbsp;heart was actually developed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term influence of&nbsp;<strong>Jerry Hall</strong>, Jagger’s wife at&nbsp;that time. Hall regularly invited Karis to&nbsp;<strong>family gatherings</strong> and made sure that all Mick’s children would spend a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>summer holidays</a> together.</p><p><h2>Jerry Hall wanted to&nbsp;keep the whole family together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d3/077/02e35c569b8c5c1a406699693b.jpg><p>Hall and Jagger, together with Marsha, attended the <strong>graduation ceremony</strong> at&nbsp;Yale University in&nbsp;1992 when Karis earned her bachelor’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>degree</a> in&nbsp;contemporary history. The father and daughter started spending more time together, which made their bond grow stronger.</p><p>They were there for each other for all their milestones. Mick walked Karis down the aisle on&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wedding</a> day, and he&nbsp;invited her to&nbsp;Buckingham Palace for his <strong>knighthood acceptance ceremony</strong> in&nbsp;2003. Karis was by&nbsp;her father’s side in&nbsp;2003&nbsp;at the funeral of&nbsp;Mick’s father, Joe, in&nbsp;2006.</p><p><h2>Karis started spending more time with her dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a45/6d4/0e555b560391e409dfa06be1d5.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seemed that Mick had finally started acting more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mature</a>, and both Marsha and he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;the grudges from the past. Karis was also <strong>accepted by&nbsp;her siblings</strong> and became an&nbsp;equal member of&nbsp;the large Jagger family.</p><p><h2>All members of&nbsp;the Jagger family accepted Karis as&nbsp;their sister.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab2/de2/69f601518e8803dce985924caa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2014, Karis was by&nbsp;her father’s side during his <strong>darkest moments</strong> when he&nbsp;was grieving the tragic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loss</a> of&nbsp;his long-term girlfriend, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>L’Wren Scott</a>. Mick flew straight to&nbsp;Karis’ Los Angeles home after he&nbsp;heard the sad news. Karis organized the funeral and was there for him throughout&nbsp;it.</p><p>Unlike some of&nbsp;Jagger’s other <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kids</a>, Karis had always maintained a&nbsp;good relationship with L’Wren, even though they were not very close. The fact that Mick chose to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;heal while spending time with the daughter he&nbsp;once disowned speaks volumes about their relationship. ’’<strong>Mick feels safe with her.

He’s picked the adult child of&nbsp;his who is&nbsp;the <strong>furthest away from showbiz nonsense</strong> and who doesn’t come with any entourage or&nbsp;baggage.” But thanks to&nbsp;her calm <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>personality</a>, she gets along well with all of&nbsp;her siblings and is&nbsp;reportedly closest to&nbsp;Jade Jagger, Mick’s second oldest child.</p><p><h2>Karis’ mom wonders if&nbsp;things would be&nbsp;different if&nbsp;Mick had been part of&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><p>Her mother Marsha credits Karis’ sensibility for her steady <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a>: “I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea how different things would have been if&nbsp;Mick had been part of&nbsp;her life, but&nbsp;I know that <strong>the influence of&nbsp;celebrity</strong>, <strong>and all that goes with&nbsp;it, is&nbsp;difficult for children</strong>,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>. No&nbsp;matter the past, it&nbsp;appears that Karis’ relationship with her father is&nbsp;only growing stronger as&nbsp;time goes&nbsp;by.</p><p>How important do&nbsp;you think a&nbsp;father figure in&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s life&nbsp;is?
