As&nbsp;he&nbsp;approached the upside-down Ford Ranger, suddenly he&nbsp;was struck with inspiration. Now, most people would only see a&nbsp;wrecked car, but this guy saw a&nbsp;whole new type of&nbsp;vehicle. He&nbsp;then took two pickups, a&nbsp;Ford Ranger and a&nbsp;Ford F-150. Then, he&nbsp;spent 6&nbsp;months working on&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange new vehicle. With the two cars combined, he&nbsp;created the illusion that there was only one. With enough room for passengers, it’s even legally approved to&nbsp;drive along the road. With the four wheels on&nbsp;top all spinning autonomously in&nbsp;line with the ones on&nbsp;the road, he&nbsp;creates confusion wherever he&nbsp;drives. Yeah, and it&nbsp;looks quite weird even perfectly parked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/272/c25/037be95ed4a1f96814ae26ab63.png><p>The importance of&nbsp;eating your greens is&nbsp;something many wholesale companies try to&nbsp;convey to&nbsp;their potential buyers. One company in&nbsp;England called Birds Eye went to&nbsp;the next level. And they built a&nbsp;car in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pea to&nbsp;promote their products. It’s built on&nbsp;the chassis of&nbsp;an&nbsp;off-road go-kart, and it&nbsp;has many parts from a&nbsp;Volkswagen beetle. It&nbsp;may look like a&nbsp;toy but it’s not: equipped with a&nbsp;small Honda engine, this little zooming green pea can even reach 60mph! Unfortunately, you won’t see it&nbsp;anywhere on&nbsp;the road, as&nbsp;its only purpose was for a&nbsp;commercial. But it&nbsp;did gain a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fame from ads. Rumor has&nbsp;it, many people even enquired about how they could purchase this weird vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/62f/7df/2c4f395105bbc6f4e8da65fa9d.png><p>In&nbsp;1964, a&nbsp;small, lightweight jeep called the Mini Moke was designed in&nbsp;the US. They offered it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Great Britain with the belief it&nbsp;would suit their terrain. Still, the car was rejected for its low ground clearance, and the open side doors weren’t quite adapted for the English weather. It&nbsp;was further offered to&nbsp;warmer climates in&nbsp;Portugal and Australia. The idea was that it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;used for tourism, and it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;an&nbsp;easy way to&nbsp;travel around. But without any other use for fun activities like four-wheel driving, it&nbsp;lost popularity. Still, with the introduction of&nbsp;electric engines, it’s making a&nbsp;comeback. Welp, it’s no&nbsp;surprise: the clearance now is&nbsp;higher, the seats are more comfortable, and the price is&nbsp;quite affordable too: the car costs about $21,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/269/dce/e2515f595ea6bd1a9a0be41212.png><p>In&nbsp;the early 20th century, cars began to&nbsp;rule the streets. Some of&nbsp;them were steam-powered, but that was far too noisy. There were even electric vehicles, but as&nbsp;they couldn’t be&nbsp;powered outside of&nbsp;cities, they also failed to&nbsp;catch&nbsp;on. But there was another, stranger design. In&nbsp;the early 1920s, the Leyat Helica was invented. It&nbsp;was also called “the plane with no&nbsp;wings”. In&nbsp;this car, the driver sits in&nbsp;the front with one passenger seated behind. The aerodynamic body of&nbsp;Leyat Helica is&nbsp;structured similarly to&nbsp;a&nbsp;plane. It’s mostly made from plywood, with a&nbsp;large propellor on&nbsp;the front to&nbsp;push the car forwards. The designer believed that all the added weight from normal car parts added unnecessary weight. At&nbsp;the time steel was incredibly important for other uses, and the lightweight frame was his solution. Weighing about 550&nbsp;pounds, this vehicle could reach speeds up&nbsp;to&nbsp;106&nbsp;mph. That all sounds fantastic, but there was a&nbsp;serious downside. The car was incredibly noisy, and to&nbsp;protect their ears people had to&nbsp;wear similar headwear as&nbsp;though they were in&nbsp;an&nbsp;actual plane. Not the best choice for a&nbsp;road trip, but surprisingly 30&nbsp;of&nbsp;these were sold!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e3b/d48/afc8a4546a8bc79f8a9774be63.png><p>With a&nbsp;shortage of&nbsp;fuel in&nbsp;the 1940s, inventors were trying to&nbsp;find alternate forms of&nbsp;transport. The electric vehicles were looked at&nbsp;again after being left on&nbsp;the drawing board for the past 30&nbsp;years. So, a&nbsp;brand-new electric car L’Oeuf Electrique was designed in&nbsp;1938 and then built in&nbsp;1942. It’s a&nbsp;3-wheeled egg-shaped vehicle, with room for only one passenger. This egg on&nbsp;wheels was powered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;battery pack. One full charge was enough for this little egg to&nbsp;travel up&nbsp;to&nbsp;63&nbsp;miles. It&nbsp;could ride along the roads at&nbsp;its top speed of&nbsp;44&nbsp;mph. This tiny car was also quite lightweight&nbsp;— only about 770&nbsp;pounds. I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I had such a&nbsp;car today, it&nbsp;would squeeze into any parking spot. Bonus: there were no&nbsp;blind spots in&nbsp;this car, with a&nbsp;270-degree view around&nbsp;it. But unfortunately, it&nbsp;didn’t catch&nbsp;on, and only one was ever made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/203/afb/84f4c35d40a4412f232dbedb00.png><p>German engineering has always been at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high standard with automobiles. And one model, the Amphicar, took them to&nbsp;another level. A&nbsp;car that could also be&nbsp;driven into the water, and could function as&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat! While driving at&nbsp;modest speeds on&nbsp;the road, the wheels are slightly lower than normal, but once in&nbsp;the water, the front wheels work as&nbsp;rudders. It&nbsp;could sail at&nbsp;a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;7&nbsp;knots. The designers were aware it&nbsp;wasn’t the best boat or&nbsp;car. So&nbsp;they advertised it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the best boat driven on&nbsp;the road, and the best car to&nbsp;sail on&nbsp;water. It&nbsp;was actually pretty decent as&nbsp;a&nbsp;seaworthy vessel. Many people were surprised that there were no&nbsp;leaks, even if&nbsp;left docked for several hours. It&nbsp;grew in&nbsp;popularity, and almost 4&nbsp;thousand vehicles were sold in&nbsp;the 1960s. It&nbsp;even inspired several more models of&nbsp;boat-cars in&nbsp;the automobile industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a6a/d53/62fad55452a7c0013f5d2c0bc5.png><p>Have you ever wanted to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;limousine? What if&nbsp;the limo is&nbsp;crossed with a&nbsp;plane? One guy decided he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;combine his love for a&nbsp;727 plane with the ability to&nbsp;drive it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the road. First, he&nbsp;found a&nbsp;plane. Then, he&nbsp;removed the wings and the tail from the body and attached the plane’s body to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mercedes Benz bus. So, it’s kinda a&nbsp;regular bus in&nbsp;a&nbsp;plane’s disguise. Stretched at&nbsp;52&nbsp;feet, it&nbsp;became the biggest limousine in&nbsp;the world. There’s enough room for 40&nbsp;people, but it&nbsp;can still drive at&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;124mph. The cockpit is&nbsp;mostly preserved, however, a&nbsp;steering wheel was replaced to&nbsp;drive the limo, for obvious reasons. The original folding staircase still works, making it&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice welcome to&nbsp;passengers while boarding the Boeing limo. Surprisingly, it’s registered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;driven on&nbsp;the road, and you can even rent this 24,000-pound limousine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/de0/335/808f0852e4b469d16bb7c64c64.png><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century, car engines became a&nbsp;lot more efficient. And the availability of&nbsp;affordable gas helped automobiles really kick off. Back in&nbsp;1927, car designers invented something REALLY posh. Meet Bugatti Royale! It&nbsp;was the most luxurious car ever made, at&nbsp;21&nbsp;feet long and weighing 7&nbsp;thousand pounds, almost twice the average weight of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sedan built today. However, at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;its creation, there was a&nbsp;great decline in&nbsp;the economies around the world. Unfortunately, this lavish car wasn’t a&nbsp;success, even the royalty of&nbsp;Europe had no&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;such an&nbsp;extravagant purchase.&nbsp;25&nbsp;had been planned to&nbsp;be&nbsp;made, but as&nbsp;interest faded only 3&nbsp;were sold. The production line ceased with only 7&nbsp;built in&nbsp;the end. The engine design was based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;French aircraft engine and is&nbsp;the largest ever built. But following the failure of&nbsp;the Bugatti Royale, the remaining engines were re-used for newly built high-speed railcars for the French railway system.</p><p>In&nbsp;1930, an&nbsp;inventor&nbsp;— John Archibald Purves&nbsp;— created something he&nbsp;believed will be&nbsp;“the high-speed vehicle of&nbsp;the future”. He&nbsp;got his inspiration from designs made by&nbsp;Leonardo Da&nbsp;Vinci. John felt that the brilliant man was onto something. He&nbsp;then created the Dynasphere, a&nbsp;mono-wheeled vehicle that ran on&nbsp;electricity. This 10&nbsp;feet high singular wheel, made from lattice iron and covered in&nbsp;leather, weighed around 1,000&nbsp;pounds. The driver’s seat and motor are connected and mounted on&nbsp;wheels. At&nbsp;first, steering was only possible when the driver leaned to&nbsp;either side, but later a&nbsp;steering wheel was implemented to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easier. It&nbsp;could reach up&nbsp;to&nbsp;30&nbsp;miles per hour. There was some interest in&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fun activity for the beach. Ah, and a&nbsp;modified version with eight seats was also made. But unfortunately, the designer’s vision of&nbsp;giant wheels covering the highways instead of&nbsp;cars didn’t come true. Probably because he&nbsp;was yet to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;stop it&nbsp;from moving, other than running into something.<br></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmnq6xXaKupbGMrZ%2BeZZKetKix0q1kpaGdpMK0tc2eZKitpGK8p3nAZqelmZ6aenl9kmptamc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-guy-made-the-biggest-limousine-out-of-a-plane-813161.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-guy-made-the-biggest-limousine-out-of-a-plane-813161.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-guy-made-the-biggest-limousine-out-of-a-plane-813161.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-guy-made-the-biggest-limousine-out-of-a-plane-813161.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-guy-made-the-biggest-limousine-out-of-a-plane-813161.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-guy-made-the-biggest-limousine-out-of-a-plane-813161.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tupac-shakur.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tupac-shakur.html>Tupac Shakur (Rapper) - On This Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-real-simon-cowell-wont-be-talking-during-the-agt-season-18-auditions.html>The Real Simon Cowell Won't Be Talking During The 'AGT' Season 18 Auditions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-real-simon-cowell-wont-be-talking-during-the-agt-season-18-auditions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
