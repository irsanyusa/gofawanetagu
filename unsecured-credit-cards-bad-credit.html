Since Tomo links to your bank account for autopay and you don’t carry a balance on the card, it is impossible to get into debt trouble. This means that holding this card will have a much higher likelihood of increasing your credit score. Even though Tomo doesn’t perform credit checks, it does report to the three credit bureaus, which will help your credit score. Plus, it is one of the few credit cards on this list that provides additional benefits and credits like $5 off DoorDash each month, free ShopRunner membership and cell phone protection for stolen or damaged phones.</p><p>Tomo Credit is another card issuer that approves applicants based on information other than a traditional credit score. That’s one of the reasons it's able to offer a credit card with no annual fee for applicants with bad credit. However, Tomo requires you to link your bank account and set up autopay, and it doesn’t charge interest rates. So it’s not a card for those who need to borrow money. There’s no annual fee for this card.</p><p>The Tomo Credit Card can offer limits of up to $10,000 because it approves applicants based on information other than a traditional credit score. Just keep in mind that Tomo requires you to link your bank account and set up autopay and doesn’t charge interest rates.

A review of the top cards was then conducted by one of the nation’s leading credit card experts with more than 15 years of experience. After review, the top cards for each category were selected.</p><h2 id=how-to-select-the-best-unsecured-credit-card-for-bad-credit>How to select the best unsecured credit card for bad credit</h2><p>When selecting the best unsecured credit card for bad credit, it's important to consider a few key factors.</p><h3>Is this card for people with bad credit?</h3><p>Make sure the card is specifically designed for individuals whose credit matches yours. If your credit is considered bad, a card for people with fair or no credit may not work for you.</p><h3>What is the card’s standard interest rate?</h3><p>Pay attention to the card's standard interest rate. This can significantly impact your finances if you need to carry a balance. Look for a card with a reasonable interest rate, keeping in mind that qualifying for a low interest rate may be a challenge if your credit score is low.</p><h3>What are the fees associated with the card?</h3><p>Likewise, carefully examine the card's fees, including annual, application, foreign transaction, additional cardholder, and balance transfer fees. You may be unable to avoid all these fees, but the fewer fees there are, the better.</p><h3>What are my priorities?</h3><p>Consider your priorities and preferences. Whether you're seeking a card for travel, cash-back rewards, or simply aiming for the lowest possible annual fee, aligning the card's features with your financial needs and goals is essential.</p><h2 id=how-to-apply-for-an-unsecured-credit-card>How to apply for an unsecured credit card</h2><p>To apply for an unsecured credit card for bad credit, follow these steps:</p><h3>Check your credit score</h3><p>Check your credit score to determine whether you meet the minimum eligibility criteria for an unsecured credit card designed for those with bad credit.</p><h3>Research suitable cards</h3><p>Look for unsecured credit cards specifically tailored for individuals with bad credit. Compare credit score requirements, features, and fees to find a card that best fits your financial situation.</p><h3>Gather necessary documents</h3><p>Collect the necessary documents—including ID, proof of income, and alternative data, if permitted—based on the credit card issuer's requirements.</p><h3>Complete the application</h3><p>Visit the website of the chosen credit card issuer or apply through other designated channels. Complete the application form with accurate personal and financial information.</p><h3>Wait for approval</h3><p>After submitting your application, wait for the credit card issuer to review your application. Approval timelines vary, but some issuers provide instant approval decisions.</p><h3>Understand the terms</h3><p>If approved, carefully review the terms and conditions of the credit card, including the interest rate, fees, and credit limit. Make sure they match the terms you originally expected.</p><h3>Activate and use the card responsibly</h3><p>Once you receive the card, activate it as per the issuer's instructions and use it responsibly to improve your credit score over time.</p><h2 id=more-about-unsecured-credit-cards>More about unsecured credit cards</h2><p>It’s important to understand what an unsecured credit card is and what it isn’t, as well as what it takes to qualify before you make the effort to secure one.</p><h3>What is an unsecured credit card?</h3><p>An unsecured credit card is a type of credit card that does not require you to provide a security deposit to open or maintain the account. Unsecured credit cards are issued based on your creditworthiness and financial history. They typically have higher interest rates and fees for individuals with bad credit, but they offer the convenience of not having to tie up funds in a security deposit and can help you build or rebuild your credit when used responsibly.</p><h3>Types of unsecured credit cards</h3><p>Unsecured credit cards can come in various types to cater to different financial needs and credit profiles. Some common types of unsecured credit cards include:</p><h4>Standard unsecured credit card</h4><p>These traditional credit cards do not require a security deposit and are issued based on your creditworthiness. The higher your credit rating, the lower the interest rate, and vice versa.</p><h4>Unsecured credit card for bad xredit</h4><p>Unsecured credit cards designed for those with bad credit include traditional credit cards with higher interest rates, annual fees, and penalties, as well as cards that utilize alternative credit data such as rent payments, spending patterns—even social network data—to determine creditworthiness.</p><h4>Student credit cards</h4><p>Designed for college students or individuals with limited credit history, student credit cards are unsecured cards that often come with lower credit limits and may offer incentives tailored to student needs, such as rewards for good grades or credit education resources.</p><h4>Retail store credit cards</h4><p>These unsecured credit cards are issued by specific retail stores and can only be used for purchases at the issuing retailer. They often come with special discounts, rewards, or financing options for store purchases.</p><h4>Low-Interest or 0% Intro APR credit cards</h4><p>Some unsecured credit cards offer low ongoing interest rates or introductory 0% APR periods on purchases or balance transfers, making them suitable for individuals looking to save on interest costs.</p><h4>Rewards credit cards</h4><p>These unsecured cards offer rewards programs, such as cash back, travel rewards, or points for purchases, providing cardholders with benefits for using the card for everyday spending.</p><h3>Pros & cons of unsecured credit cards for bad credit</h3><p>When considering credit cards for people with bad credit, there are several pros and cons to remember.</p><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Opportunity to rebuild your credit over time by responsibly using a credit card for bad credit.</li><li>Access to financial resources provided by an unsecured card can provide you with a safety net in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses.</li><li>Potential for credit limit increases based on your responsible use of the card and positive marks on your credit report.</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Higher interest rates are a fact of life with credit cards for bad credit, leading to increased costs if the card balance is not paid in full each month.</li><li>Fees, including annual fees, monthly maintenance fees, or other charges, can add to the card's overall cost.</li><li>Limited rewards and benefits, compared to cards designed for individuals with better credit, can make credit cards for bad credit less beneficial to your bottom line.</li></ul><h3>Unsecured vs secured credit card</h3><p>Secured and unsecured credit cards differ in how they are backed and who can qualify for them.</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Secured credit cards</a> require a security deposit, which serves as collateral and determines the credit limit. These cards are usually available to individuals with poor or no credit history. On the other hand, unsecured credit cards do not require a security deposit but are typically designed for individuals with fair to excellent credit scores.</p><p>Unsecured cards rely solely on the borrower's promise to pay, and the credit limit is based on the cardholder's creditworthiness. Secured credit cards often have lower fees and interest rates than unsecured cards, as they pose less risk to the issuer.</p><p>An unsecured credit card might make more sense than a secured credit card when you have bad credit but want to build or rebuild your credit history without tying up a significant amount of funds in a security deposit. Additionally, if you are looking for a credit card with rewards, perks, and lower annual fees, an unsecured credit card might be a more attractive option than a secured card.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-apply-for-an-unsecured-credit-card-to-build-or-rebuild-your-credit-score>TIME Stamp: Apply for an unsecured credit card to build or rebuild your credit score</h2><p>If your credit score is bad, your primary goal should be to improve it. The best way to raise your credit score is by responsible use of an unsecured credit card. If you can qualify for an unsecured card, you will likely face higher interest rates, fees, and potential penalties than someone with a higher score. Provided you use the card responsibly, these “costs of bad credit” will do little harm and will eventually help qualify you for lower rates and fees, and better rewards because the issuer will want to keep you as a customer.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Can I get an unsecured credit card with a 500 credit score?</h3><p>Yes, there are several unsecured credit cards that are offered to those with credit scores of 500 or less.</p><h3>What is an unsecured credit card for bad credit?</h3><p>These are cards thatare designed for people with bad credit.
